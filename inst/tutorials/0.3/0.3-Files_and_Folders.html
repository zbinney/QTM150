<h2>How Does Your Computer Store Files?</h2>
<p>My apologies in advance if this Tutorial feels simple or remedial for
some of you. But many of you in an era of phones and Google docs and
iPads have never had to deal with computer folders and directories.
Files just sort of appear where you need them, or you can navigate to
them without understanding what a computer is doing under the hood. This
brief (but admittedly kind of boring) Tutorial is designed to simply
ensure everyone is on the same page. The fun stuff is coming
<em>very</em> soon, I promise.</p>
<p>OK, let’s get going!</p>
<p>To keep things organized, your computer has a system for storing
data.</p>
<p>Every piece of data on a computer is stored in a
<strong>file</strong>. A file could contain a program that runs, a
spreadsheet with data, a written document with words - anything,
really.</p>
<p>Each file is located in a <strong>folder</strong>, which is just a
collection of files. Folders can contain several “sub-folders,” and all
except the highest main drive folder are themselves contained in a
<strong>parent folder</strong>.</p>
<p>The location of those folders - and thus of any given file - is
defined by a <strong>directory</strong> or <strong>file path</strong>.
(This may not be the exact computer science definition, but it’s
accurate for our purposes.)</p>
<p>The easiest way to think of files and folders may be as an analog for
your location in the physical world. Imagine your computer is the planet
earth, and each person is a single file:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a folder for each continent</li>
<li>Then a sub-folder under every continent for each country</li>
<li>Then a sub-sub-sub-folder for each city</li>
<li>…and each street</li>
<li>…and each house</li>
</ul>
<p>Each house contains one or more people/files. You “live” inside the
folder for your house, which is inside the folder for your street, which
is inside the folder for your city, and so on.</p>
<div
id="section-directoriesfile-paths-how-your-computer-finds-and-accesses-a-file"
class="section level3">
<h3>Directories/File Paths: How Your Computer Finds and Accesses a
File</h3>
<p>Now imagine you’re a police detective, and you’ve been tasked with
finding a particular person (file) - say, Homer Simpson after he stole a
pig from Springfield A&amp;M. How do you know where to look? It wouldn’t
be very efficient to just run around shouting for him. Nor would it be a
very good idea to grab a random person and treat them as Homer Simpson.
Instead, hopefully Homer has an address! You go to that address, and you
find him.</p>
<p>Homer Simpson indeed has an address. You might write it on an
envelope like this:</p>
<p>Homer Simpson <br> 742 Evergreen Terrace <br> Springfield (STATE
UNKNOWN, it’s a long-running joke from the show), USA</p>
<p>On a computer an address serves the same purpose, it would just look
a little different. The file <code>Homer_Simpson.dude</code> might live
at:
<code>Earth:/North_America/USA/Springfield/Evergreen_Terrace/House_742/Homer_Simpson.dude</code>.
Same idea!</p>
<p>Just like the detective looking for Homer Simpson, if you want your
computer to look up and access a file - an R package it needs to run,
for example, or some data you want to open - you can’t (usually) just
give it the file name and expect it to run it automatically. <em>You
have to tell it where to look first.</em></p>
<p>An important thing to realize is computers are kind of dumb. Imagine
we’re sitting in the living room and you tell me “go get me the spoon.”
I instinctively know I have to go the kitchen first to get the spoon. A
computer doesn’t. If by dumb luck you’re already in the kitchen with the
computer it might successfully get you the spoon. But if you’re in the
living room it’s going to spin around the room, burst into flames and
scream in a tone that plumbs the darkest depths of cosmic horror and
sends the most stouthearted men descending recklessly into madness
“ERROR: SPOON NOT FOUND.” You have to tell it something more like “go to
the kitchen and get me the spoon” - then it will happily do so.</p>
<p>But instead of the instructions I wrote above or an address like you
might write on an envelope, though, it needs a <strong>file
path</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to run this Tutorial I have to tell my laptop
its location, which is:
<code>C:\Users\zbinney\OneDrive - Emory University\QTM_150\Tutorials\QTM150Tutorials\inst\tutorials\0.3\0.3-Files_and_Folders.Rmd</code>.
Then it will go to that folder and open and run the file. Otherwise
it’ll get lost and angry. And then I’ll be angry. No fun.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-file-folder-and-directory-example"
class="section level3">
<h3>File, Folder, and Directory Example</h3>
<p>Here’s a screenshot of what the <strong>folder</strong> for this
Tutorial <strong>file</strong> looks like on my laptop:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Screenshot_File.png" alt="*Tutorial 0.3 file and folder.*" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
<em>Tutorial 0.3 file and folder.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>file</strong> itself is highlighted in GREEN.</p>
<p>You can see some of the <strong>file path</strong> highlighted in
YELLOW. You can see, for example, all the way at the right that the
<strong>folder</strong> containing this file is named <code>0.3</code> -
this is like the house number on an address. The folder above that,
called the <strong>parent folder</strong>, is <code>tutorials</code> -
this is like the street number. <em>Its</em> parent is <code>inst</code>
- this is like the city. And so on and so on up the chain, all the way
to my main drive folder <code>C:/</code>.</p>
<p>This folder also has two <strong>sub-folders</strong>, highlighted in
orange - <code>css</code> and <code>images</code>. In our analogy maybe
this would be like separate sub-folders for people and pets in the
house. Or maybe the analogy is breaking down here. But you get the
idea.</p>
<p>You can get more details on the location of a file in Windows by
right-clicking on the file and selecting <code>Properties</code>. This
is an example of what comes up, with the file’s location highlighted in
BLUE:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Screenshot_File_Properties.png" alt="*Tutorial 0.3 file and folder details via Properties.*" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
<em>Tutorial 0.3 file and folder details via Properties.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>The equivalent on a Mac is to command-click on the file and then
select <code>Get Info</code>.</p>
<p>If you’re using Linux, you already know better than I how to do
this.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-where-does-my-file-go-when-i" class="section level3">
<h3>Where Does My File Go When I…</h3>
<div id="section-save-it" class="section level4">
<h4>…Save It?</h4>
<p>If you select “Save As” for a file, you both give it a name
<em>and</em> place it into a folder of your choosing.</p>
<p>A folder will likely be chosen by default (usually the last place you
saved a file to when using that same program), but you can always change
it to another folder or even create an entirely new folder or sub-folder
in which to save the file. That file will then be located in that folder
until it is removed and will always be accessible through that folder’s
file path.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-download-it" class="section level4">
<h4>…Download It?</h4>
<p>When you download a file, it will often go to a folder on your
computer labeled “Downloads.” The file will be accessible there through
that folder’s file path (for example, on my laptop that’s
<code>C:\Users\zbinney\Downloads</code>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div
id="section-where-should-i-store-my-files-best-practices-for-staying-organized"
class="section level3">
<h3>Where Should I Store My Files: Best Practices for Staying
Organized</h3>
<p>You really should take the time (a couple hours at most) to create a
sensible organization system for your files.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example, you might have one big folder on your desktop or
(better and safer - it’ll save your ass in case your computer crashes!)
your Emory Shared Drive or another area that’s automatically backed up
for your <code>Personal</code> documents, and another for your
<code>School</code> or <code>Class</code> or <code>Oxford</code>
documents.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inside that <code>School</code> or <code>Class</code> or
<code>Oxford</code> folder, you could have sub-folders for each
<code>Class</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside each <code>Class</code> folder you could have a sub-folder
for each assignment, like <code>HW1</code>. Or for each type of
assignment, like <code>HW</code>, and then sub-folders within that for
each assignment like <code>HW1</code>, <code>HW2</code>, etc. You simply
create these sub-folders as needed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This may seem like a lot of work to put in, and you’ll be tempted to
skip it with all the other demands on your time. But the cost is minimal
- an hour or two at most upfront and a few thoughtful seconds each time
you create or download a new file to decide where to put it. And I
promise it will save you <em>many hours</em> of frustration later when
you can’t figure out where the hell you put the latest version of that
assignment that you procrastinated on and have to upload in the next 4
minutes. Trust me.</p>
<div id="section-the-last-temptation-of-the-downloads-folder"
class="section level4">
<h4>The Last Temptation of the Downloads Folder</h4>
<p>One temptation you’ll need to avoid is just keeping everything you
download in the Downloads folder in one huge pile. Sometimes keeping a
file there is OK if it’s a file you’re only going to access once or a
few times, like the takeout menu for a restaurant or some sort of form
you need to sign and then forget about.</p>
<p>But for important files you’ll want to access over and over again -
like, say, THE FILES YOU DOWNLOAD FROM CANVAS FOR THIS COURSE - saving
them separate from everything else in their own bespoke folder will save
you hours of frustrated scrolling through your Downloads folder trying
to find the right version of that homework to turn in, or the Tutorial
where you filled out all the code rather an old version, or that handy
cheatsheet of common R errors I sent you. You can either do this right
when you download the file(s) by telling it to save to its proper
folder, or just after by simply moving the file(s) (through copy-paste
or drag-and-drop) from the Downloads folder to its new home.</p>
<p>OK, I think that’s it for now. I hope this gets everyone on the same
page with regards to how files are stored on a computer, how it looks
for them when you ask it to, and some best practices for storing them on
your own machines.
