<h2>How to Read This Document</h2>
<p>This document - and all the other future ones in this course - are
interactive tutorials, built using Quarto and the <code>learnr</code>
<strong>package</strong> in R (we’ll talk more about what Quarto and
“package” mean in a moment). You have the opportunity to actually run R
code in this document itself in “Exercises.” There are also sometimes
“Questions” for you to answer and test your knowledge.</p>
<p>On the left hand side you’ll see a Table of Contents menu that lets
you navigate from section to section. Within each section, there are
<em>sub-sections</em> that are revealed one-by-one by clicking the
“Continue” button at the bottom of the page. Make sure you keep going
until you exhaust each section before moving on to the next one. You’ll
know you’re done when “Continue” sends you to a new page - the next
section on the left hand side - rather than just adding more text to the
existing page (which indicates you’ve revealed a new sub-section).</p>
<p>Although you can run interactive code here, my advice is for you to
also re-type the code over in your own R <strong>script</strong> -
you’ll learn what that means below - on the side. This helps for the
same reason taking notes is better than just sitting there listening to
me talk. Writing things down helps with memory and understanding.</p>
<p>WARNING: if you try to do this while running a Tutorial, you may
notice it won’t seem to run. That’s because you can’t run both at the
same time in the same RStudio “session.” RStudio has to dedicate all its
attention in one session to watching the interactive tutorial. But
there’s a super easy fix to do both at the same time: in the top menu go
to Session &gt; New Session. This will open up a second RStudio window.
You should be able to run any code you want in that second window while
the first one keeps an eye on your tutorial. (Note you can run code in
the tutorial without a second session, this is only for if you want to
follow along and code in your own script as you go.)</p>
<p>You can walk away and come back to these documents as many times as
you like - R magically saves your place and the work you’ve done, as
long as you’re using the same machine. No need to do it all in one
sitting.</p>

<div id="section-r-vs.-rstudio-vs.-quarto" class="section level2">
<h2>R vs. RStudio vs. Quarto</h2>
<div id="section-intro" class="section level3">
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>There are (at least) 3 confusingly named things in this course we
should tease out right from the start:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>R is the actual programming language we’ll be using. It was
developed specifically for data analysis and statistics. Other languages
you may be familiar with, like C++ or Java, are more “general purpose”
languages that do a broader set of computer-y things but aren’t as
specialized or easy to work with for data analysis and
statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>RStudio is an interface for using R. It’s made by a company
called…you guessed it, RStudio, that also does a lot of education and
promotion around the R language. It makes programming in R much more
pleasant but isn’t technically <em>necessary</em> to program in
R.</p></li>
<li><p>Quarto. It’s what I used to produce this cool interactive
document. It’s a way of using a language called “Markdown” alongside R
code, in the RStudio interface, to create pretty reports, presentations,
and other documents that interweave your code, graphics, and explanatory
text. It’s also how you will submit your homework.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can just write R code with written comments in an R “script” (a
file of code that ends <code>.R</code>). But Quarto creates a
<code>.qmd</code> file that lets you write and format (e.g. bolding and
italicizing and bullets) text to explain your commented code and also
show its output, and then share that as a website (HTML output), PDF
document, or many other options.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Some analogies may help. Let’s go to our first interactive question
of the course!</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="r-analogies" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="r-analogies-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="r-analogies-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="r-analogies-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you have found the right answer above, type it between the
quotation marks below.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="r-analogy-exercise"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>x &lt;- &quot;&quot;

<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Now you can continue to the next sub-section, which I didn’t want you
to see until you finished this section. Isn’t that neat? (Technically,
because I didn’t set any way to <em>check</em> this exercise all you had
to do was click <code>Run</code>, but don’t worry about that.) You can
do all sorts of cool stuff with R, RStudio, and Quarto.</p>

<p>R itself (or more specifically, R code you write in the default R
interface) is like a film strip - it has the movie (code) on it, and by
sliding the filmstrip past your eyes you could technically sort of watch
the movie, but it would be really unpleasant.</p>
<p>RStudio, then, is a prettier interface to work with and watch the
movie - a projector you put the movie (code) in and display and edit
using a beautiful, easy-to-watch screen.</p>
<p>Quarto is an alternative way of presenting your movie (code). It
allows you to add more depth to your movie (code) by adding in extra
information like a narrative discussion of what you did and why, or the
output of the code. The movie (code) is still there, but now it has a
bunch of extra features like what might come on a DVD if any of you
still watch those. It allows an even richer movie-watching
experience.</p>

class="section level2">
<h2>Basic R Programming + Your First Visualization!</h2>
<div id="section-what-is-r-code" class="section level3">
<h3>What is R code?</h3>
<p>“R code” - or any computer code - is basically text asking your
computer to do something. It’s a set of instructions. In the same way
that I might ask you to stand up, walk over to the bathroom, and wash
your hands, I could write some text in a very specific format to tell R
“add 1 + 1, then assign that value to a variable called <code>x</code>
and store that result somewhere.”</p>
<p>R, like any programming language, only understands how to do certain
things. I can’t make R wash its hands because that’s a meaningless
concept for it. In the same way, if I told you “Attach the gleebglorb to
the funkanizer using a muchowallop,” you would have no idea how to do
that because you don’t know what a gleebglorb, funkanizer, or
muchowallop are, and you never will because they’re fake words.</p>
<p>R, because of how and for whom it was designed, “natively” knows how
to do a lot of things important for data analysis and statistics but
isn’t great at some other things. We can teach it to be better at some
things to an extent, though, and we’ll discuss that below. Another
language you may have heard of, Python, is great at a broader range of
things but less specialized for data analysis.</p>
<p>Another point to consider as you start your programming journey is
that computers, unlike humans, are literal and obedient. It will always
do <em>exactly</em> what you tell it to. That may not be what you
intended, though, and computers have funny ways of interpreting some
things you type. For example, if I asked you to “run over to the store
and get some milk,” you would be able to interpret this in the context
of the store being 10 miles away, leading you to drive there rather than
literally run. A computer would try to sprout legs, put on shoes, and
run 10 miles to the store to get the milk unless you gave it the
important context that, actually, here “run” means “get in a car and
drive.” This can be a very frustrating experience for new programmers -
you will make lots of errors, and that’s OK, even good! Just keep that
in mind throughout our journey.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-some-very-basic-r-code-examples"
class="section level3">
<h3>Some very basic R code examples</h3>
<p>Below are some pieces of code that R understands. In Quarto,
<code>R code is displayed in a grey box like this</code> (unless it’s
part of an exercise in this interactive tutorial), and R’s answer after
running that code appears in a box with a white background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here’s R doing some basic arithmetic that also illustrates the
difference between how static code and an interactive exercise look in
these tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>#This is static code and output in Quarto.  This green text is a &quot;Comment&quot; that is not run as code.

2+7</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 9</code></pre>
<p>This is an interactive exercise; once you click run, it will also
show output below.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="arithmetic-ex"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>2+7</code></pre>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Here’s R evaluating a <strong>function</strong> (called
<code>sum()</code>) with <strong>arguments</strong> (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).
We’ll talk more about functions and arguments later, but what you do
think the function <code>sum()</code> tells R to do? What will the
answer be when you run this code?</li>
</ul>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="sum" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>sum(1,2,3,4,5)</code></pre>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Here’s R assigning a value to <strong>objects</strong> - the things
you manipulate in R. For example, you can create an object called
<code>x</code> that you give the value 2. The way you “give” an “object”
a “value” is to use the <strong>assignment operator</strong>
<code>&lt;-</code>. The easiest way to translate the below code into
English is “x gets 2” or “x receives 2”:</li>
</ul>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="assignment"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>x &lt;- 2

x</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Your turn! Make R assign 37 to an object
called <code>randall</code>, and print it.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="assignment2"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Once you’ve assigned a value to an object, R will remember that and
you can use that object for other actions later. For example, what do
you think the below code will return? Run it and see if you’re
right!</li>
</ul>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="object-use"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>x &lt;- 2

x + 35</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Now try changing the above code so x + 35
produces your favorite number. Congratulations, you’re an R
programmer!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-your-first-visualization" class="section level3">
<h3>Your First Visualization!</h3>
<p>Let’s do something more interesting, though, both to show you the
power of R and because your head is probably spinning a bit right now.
I’ve adapted this exercise from <a href="http://datascienceinabox.org"
class="uri">http://datascienceinabox.org</a>, a course developed by
Dr. Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and distributed under the <a
href="https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/blob/master/LICENSE.md">CC
BY-SA 4.0 license</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the voting history of countries in the United
Nations General Assembly. We will be using data from the
<code>unvotes</code> package. Additionally, we will make use of the
<code>tidyverse</code> and <code>lubridate</code> packages for the
analysis, and the <code>DT</code> package for interactive display of
tabular output. Note we (you) already <em>installed</em> these packages
in Tutorial 0.1, so now we just have to <em>load</em> them (we’ll
discuss this more below, but it basically means tell R “hey, we’re about
to use these packages so get ready”).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(unvotes)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(DT)</code></pre>
<p>The unvotes package<a href="#section-fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="section-fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> provides three
<strong>datasets</strong> we can work with: <code>un_roll_calls</code>,
<code>un_roll_call_issues</code>, and <code>un_votes</code>. Each of
these datasets contains a <strong>variable</strong> called
<code>rcid</code>, the roll call id, which indicates a specific voting
topic and can be used as a unique identifier to join them with each
other.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>un_votes</code> dataset provides information on the voting
history of the United Nations General Assembly. It contains one row for
each country-vote pair. Here are the first 200 rows of that dataset.
Make sure to try scrolling over to the right to see all the
variables!</li>
</ul>

<h2>How and where can I run R code?</h2>
<div id="section-rstudio-layout" class="section level3">
<h3>RStudio Layout</h3>
<p>It will be helpful to start with a map of what happens when you open
a .R or .qmd file (some code) in RStudio. Here’s a tour of the basic
areas:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/RStudio_windows.png" alt="*RStudio when you open a code script.*" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
<em>RStudio when you open a code script.</em>
</p>
</div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>Console</strong>. This is where you can type some
code and, as soon as you press “Enter,” it runs once. We’ll talk more
about its uses in a moment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scripts</strong>. These are .R files of code that you
write and save, just like a Word document. You can run them over and
over again. We’ll talk more about this in a moment, too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Environment</strong>. There are several
<strong>tabs</strong> here, but the most relevant one is “Environment.”
This lists <strong>objects</strong> specific to your current R session -
for example, datasets you’ve imported (e.g. <code>diamonds</code> in the
image) or new objects you create and assign values to (like assigning
the value “37” to <code>x</code>). Note objects like <code>x</code>
could also contain a single <strong>string</strong> of text or a series
of values (numbers, text, or other things) all bound together called, in
R parlance, <strong>vectors</strong> or <strong>lists</strong>. We’ll
talk more about those another time.</p></li>
<li><p>A miscellaneous window. There are a few important things in this
pane:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><strong>Files</strong> - this lists the files and folders in your
<strong>working directory</strong> (typically, where the script you’re
working in is located). I don’t use it all that often to be honest.</li>
<li><strong>Plots</strong> - when you create a plot by running code in a
<strong>script</strong>, this is where it shows up (it will show up
in-line in the Quarto document if you produce it there).</li>
<li><strong>Packages</strong> - this is the list of R
<strong>packages</strong> (bits of code that do extra stuff) you have
installed on your machine. More on them below.</li>
<li><strong>Help</strong> - I end up here all the time. When you need to
look up details about how to do something in R, you can type
<code>?[function_name]</code> in the <strong>Console</strong> and it
will pull up information here. For example, try typing <code>?sum</code>
into your <strong>Console</strong> and see what pops up.</li>
<li><strong>Viewer</strong> - sometimes the result of some code you run
from a <strong>script</strong> will pop up here. It will happen
automatically as necessary, so you don’t need to know much more about
it.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you’ve got the lay of the land, let’s talk about how you can
run code in R.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-option-1-directly-in-the-console-rare"
class="section level3">
<h3>Option 1: Directly in the <strong>Console</strong> (Rare)</h3>
<p>The <strong>Console</strong> is on the lower left hand corner of
RStudio (though it will be the entire left hand side of the screen when
you open RStudio without a <strong>script</strong> or Quarto file, such
as the first time you turn it on).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to use it: Just type your R code in the Console after the
<code>&gt;</code> symbol and hit Enter.</p></li>
<li><p>Pros: Quick and easy; don’t have to open up, name, and save a
<strong>script</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Cons: Nothing saves. You can’t track your work, save it for
later, or run the code again and again like you’ll want to do most of
the time.</p></li>
<li><p>When to use it: for code you only want to write and run
<em>once</em>. This can be a quick single line of code you’re testing
out or something like ‘install.packages()’ that you only need to run one
time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Try asking R to perform some basic arithmetic
operations through the Console.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-option-2-r-script-common" class="section level3">
<h3>Option 2: R <strong>Script</strong> (Common)</h3>
<p>An R script is basically a text file in which you write R code that
you then submit to RStudio.</p>
<p>To open a new script, in the upper left hand corner click
<code>File</code> &gt; <code>New File</code> &gt;
<code>R Script</code>.</p>
<p>RStudio should now look more or less like the screenshot above,
except with a blank script labeled <code>Untitled1</code>. The first
thing you should do is save your script as another name, like
<code>My_Analaysis.R</code> (except something more descriptive). You
should also choose a sensible directory to put it in.</p>
<p>You can now write the code you <em>plan</em> on running in the script
window.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/RStudio_script.png" alt="*R script.*" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
<em>R script.</em>
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>How to use it: Type your R code in the script, and save
frequently. Here’s a picture of a basic script that doesn’t do much but
illustrates the basics.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RStudio does some automatic text formatting, for example putting
numbers in blue and anything inside quotes in green.</p></li>
<li><p>You can only write two things in an R script: code and comments.
<strong>Comments</strong> are text that explain to others (and future
you) what some code is meant to do. You make them by typing
<code>#</code> at the start of any line. Commenting code is
<em>extremely</em> important - however many you think you need to write,
write more.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pro-tip</strong>: You can also “comment out” large blocks of
code you don’t actually want to run - like old code you’re not quite
ready to delete yet. To do this, you highlight the code and hit
<code>Ctrl/Command + Shift + C</code>. Try it on some code you write. It
turns the code into comments that R ignores.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You can run your code one of three main ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you just want to run a single line or block of code (such as
the <code>ggplot()</code> blocks we’ll encounter below), just put your
cursor anywhere in the block and hit
<code>Ctrl/Command + Enter</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to run several lines or blocks of code, highlight
them and click <code>Ctrl/Command + Enter</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to run the whole script start to finish, click the
little “Run” icon in the right hand side of the ribbon above the
script.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The code output will show up in the Console, Plots, or Viewer
pane, depending on what you ran.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Pros: Saves your code so you can run it over and over
again.</p></li>
<li><p>Cons: If you share the script all you see is your code and
comments, not all the pretty formatting and output you can include in an
Quarto document.</p></li>
<li><p>When to use it: if you don’t care about sharing your code with
non-analysts, people who can’t run it themselves, and you don’t want to
fold in output and graphs into a pretty PDF or HTML document that looks
more like a report than a code script.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark>: Create a script, save it, pre-type some R
code, and run it through the three above methods. Try summing your five
favorite numbers, or printing 2 x pi, or whatever else you can. Write a
comment explaining what your code does.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-option-3-quarto-document-most-common-for-this-class"
class="section level3">
<h3>Option 3: Quarto Document (Most Common for This Class)</h3>
<p>The R installation instructions you read through last week were the
product of Quarto. Quarto files weave together explanatory text (beyond
code comments), code, and the output from that code to make a readable
report you can share with anyone, including non-programmers! You can
create web pages (HTML), Word documents, PDFs, whole blogs, and even
books. It’s an incredibly flexible way to write code and present your
findings and is much prettier and complete than a script.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to use it: You write text and code in a <code>.qmd</code>
file just like you would in a script, except you have a lot more
options. You then <strong>knit</strong> this <code>.qmd</code> file into
your desired output, such as a web page (HTML) or PDF. More
below.</p></li>
<li><p>Pros: You can organize narrative text, code, and output (like
tables and graphs) in a single document. To make an update or change all
you have to do is change a bit of code (and text if necessary) and
re-knit the document. Way easier than working in R and then, say,
copying the plots over into a Word document.</p></li>
<li><p>Cons: More complex than just writing a script.</p></li>
<li><p>When to use it: any time you want to share your output with
non-programmers (like a supervisor), have a report-style document that
needs regular updating, or just want a prettier product!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But it doesn’t innately know, for example, what the mathematical
constant <code>e</code> is:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="know-e" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">

</div>
<p>Nor does it know the function <code>beep()</code> for making…well,
one of several kinds of beep noises:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="year-test"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">

</div>
<p>This is because you have to teach R some new things. First, another
analogy. Do you like babies or phones?</p>
<div id="section-baby" class="section level4">
<h4>Baby Analogy</h4>
<p>Think of newly-installed R like a baby - it can breathe, look around,
poop - it’s really impressive! But it’s capable of so much more. You
just have to teach it new skills. We do that by installing
<strong>packages</strong>, which is like teaching your R baby a new
skill such as walking or talking.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-phone" class="section level4">
<h4>Phone Analogy</h4>
<p>Think of newly-installed R like a new phone you just bought - it can
make calls, send texts, access the internet - it’s really impressive!
But it’s capable of so much more. So you install some apps like
Instagram or one that lets you play the game backgammon. The R
equivalent to installing apps is installing
<strong>packages</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-packages-functions-and-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Packages, Functions, and Objects</h3>
<p>Packages are bits of standalone code, written by others, that when
<strong>installed</strong> (and <strong>loaded</strong>) allow R to do
different things it couldn’t before.</p>
<p>Most often these add one or more new <strong>functions</strong> to
those R knew before.</p>
<p>R <strong>functions</strong> are just like mathematical functions.
Consider f(x) = 2x. The function, f(), takes one or more inputs (or in
computer terms, <strong>arguments</strong>, in this case “x”), does
something to those inputs, and returns an output. Note functions can,
and often do, take more than one argument.</p>
<p>Consider the <code>sum()</code> function in R - which is one that R
just innately knows. It takes as its <strong>arguments</strong> any
number of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="sum2" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>sum(2,3,5,7,11)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Sometimes packages also add <strong>objects</strong> such as new
datasets or color palettes - for example, the <code>unvotes</code>
package added those datasets we played with above.</p>
<p>To make R learn and use new things from a package you have to do two
things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Install</strong> the package. You only have to do this
<em>once</em> on any computer you’re using (though you do want to
regularly <strong>update</strong> them to the latest version, too). It
stays there forever unless you uninstall it. Since this is something you
do infrequently you typically run this code in the
<strong>Console</strong>. Here’s code to install the
<code>RColorBrewer</code> package, which adds some neat and accessible
color palettes for graphs:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;RColorBrewer&quot;) </code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Load</strong> packages. You have to do this every time you
turn R on - when you leave or restart R it goes back to its innate
functions only. This is code you have to run over and over, so it should
be placed in a <strong>script</strong> or Quarto document rather than
the console.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>library(RColorBrewer)</code></pre>
<p>A good analogy for all this is a lightbulb. To get light you have to
do two things: screw in the bulb, and flip a switch on. Installing a
package is like screwing in the bulb - you only have to do it once, and
it’s there for you in the future. Loading it is like flipping the
lightswitch - you have to do this every time you want the light.</p>

id="section-now-forget-install.packages-and-library.-use-the-p_load-function-from-the-pacman-package-instead"
class="section level4">
<h4>Now Forget <code>install.packages()</code> and
<code>library()</code>. Use the <code>p_load()</code> Function from the
<code>pacman</code> Package Instead!</h4>
<p>I want you to use the <code>p_load()</code> function from the
<code>pacman</code> package. This function has two big benefits: it can
load as many packages as you want, separated by commas (while
<code>library()</code> can only do one at a time); and it automatically
installs any packages in that list it detects you’re missing. Magical!
Here’s how you use it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pacman::p_load(tidyverse, RColorBrewer, &lt;OTHER PACKAGE NAMES HERE&gt;)</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: You’ll often see functions from packages written like
<code>pacman::p_load()</code>. You can read this as “p_load() from the
pacman package.” The bit before “::” is the package the function is part
of, and the bit after is the function name itself. This is used for two
main reasons. First, because sometimes two packages have functions with
the same name. For example, just <code>filter()</code> could refer to a
function from the native <code>stats</code> package (which comes with
your basic R installation) or the <code>dplyr</code> package (part of
the <code>tidyverse</code> you’ve already installed). So if you want the
<code>filter()</code> from <code>dplyr</code> it’s useful to specify
<code>dplyr::filter()</code>.</p>
<p>This is not only useful, but sometimes <em>necessary</em> because R
has to choose one <code>filter()</code> function to be its default. When
you load <code>tidyverse</code> it will override the
<code>stats::filter()</code> to make <code>dplyr::filter()</code> the
default. If you just write <code>filter()</code>, then, R will run
<code>dplyr::filter()</code>. If you - more rarely - want
<code>stats::filter()</code> you have to explicitly say so.</p>
<p>The other reason you use the <code>::</code> syntax is to avoid
needing to load the package you’re accessing first. We want to use
<code>pacman</code> to load other packages - it would be annoying to
have to use <code>library()</code> to first load <code>pacman</code>. So
we bypass that by using the <code>::</code> syntax to tell R “Hey, no
need to load the whole <code>pacman</code> package, just access it
briefly to run the <code>p_load()</code> function to load some other
packages.”</p>
</div>
<div id="section-example-help-pages" class="section level4">
<h4>Example + Help Pages</h4>
<p>You already have some experience installing packages, but let’s
install one more while we’re here: <code>beepr</code>.</p>
<p>Try running the below code in your R console <em>before</em>
installing and loading the tidyverse package and see how R responds.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>beep(1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error in `beep()`:
## ! could not find function &quot;beep&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Oops! It doesn’t know the function <code>beep()</code>. So let’s
install and load the <code>beepr</code> package by running this code in
your Console: <code>pacman::p_load("beepr")</code></p>
<p>Now try running this code again in your Console or a script:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>beep(1)</code></pre>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark>: If you want to know what a function does,
look up its <strong>Help</strong> page using
<code>?[Function Name]</code> in the Console. For example, try
<code>?beep</code>. How many different sounds can you play with
<code>beep()</code>? Try some and see which you like!</p>

</div>
<div id="section-creating-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating Objects</h3>
<p>While you can add things using packages, often you’ll also want to
create your own <strong>objects</strong>, such as new datasets, that
don’t exist when you first start up R. As briefly discussed above, you
do this using the <strong>assignment operator</strong>
<code>&lt;-</code>. For example:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="love-class"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>#Try printing something called love_this_class. What happened?
love_this_class</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="love-class2"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>#Complete this code to create a new object called love_this_class that&#39;s just the simple text string below
&quot;Yeah, I know, this class is great&quot;

#Now that the object exists, print it</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p><strong>Pro-tip</strong>: <code>&lt;-</code> is a pain to type
manually. Instead, use the shortcut Alt + Minus Sign.</p>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Add your own object to R, then ask R to
return its value.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-quarto-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Quarto Overview</h2>
<p>I can’t show you the full capabilities of Quarto in an interactive
tutorial. Instead, I want you to open up your own file. To do that while
viewing this tutorial you need to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a new <strong>Session</strong> (open a new RStudio
window). Click <code>Session</code> &gt;
<code>New Session</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new Quarto file. Click <code>File</code>, then
<code>New file</code>, then <code>Quarto Document</code>. When a window
pops up, just click “OK” for now.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have something that looks like this in your script
area:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/RStudio_Quarto.png" alt="*New Quarto document.*" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
<em>New Quarto document.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s walk through the document, top to bottom. But first…</p>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> <strong>Knit</strong> your first Quarto
document! Knit the default raw <code>.qmd</code> file into an HTML
document by hitting the <code>Render</code> button on the top ribbon. It
should pop up in a new window. Now you can start to compare parts of the
raw Quarto with what it prints in a finished document!</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>You Ain’t a Markup Language (YAML) Header</strong>. This
is always the first thing in an Quarto document, and it’ll look
something like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>    ---
    title: &quot;Untitled&quot;
    format: html
    ---</code></pre>
<pre><code>-   title: the title on the final rendered document. Note what it looks like in your rendered document.

-   format: the format of the finished document when you click on the &quot;Render&quot; button. It&#39;ll look like a web page. To render a PDF instead, change this line to `pdf`. Note this isn&#39;t explicitly printed anywhere in the finished document; it tells the finished document what format to take.

-   It&#39;s useful to add two other fields as a general practice. 
author: the author on the final knitted document. Note what it looks like in your rendered document.
date: hopefully self-explanatory at this point. Note what it looks like in your rendered document.

-   There are plenty of other things you can add to your header. SEE the Quarto cheat sheet for some examples, but most of them probably look like gibberish to you right now. And that&#39;s OK!</code></pre>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Change the title and add an author name and
date to your HTML document. Re-render it to see the change
reflected.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>Heading</strong> followed by some text. Compare how
it’s written in the raw Quarto to the finished document. We’ll discuss
this more below.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Code Chunk</strong> that looks like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Code_Chunk.png" alt="*A code chunk.*" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
<em>A code chunk.</em>
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Notice how the chunk appears in the raw Quarto versus how it’s
rendered and printed in the final document. You see the code <em>and the
output</em>. The output is identical to what you’d see in the
<strong>console</strong> if you just ran the code there or in a script
(try it if you don’t believe me!).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Below this is just another header, text, and code chunk that
demonstrates how you can run chunks with certain options, which we will
discuss later.</p>
<div id="section-code-chunks" class="section level3">
<h3>Code Chunks</h3>
<p>As we’ve already seen you can weave in chunks of R code between
blocks of explanatory text.</p>
<p>To create a new chunk place the cursor where you want it and
either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click on the “+c” button in the ribbon menu then <code>R</code>,
or</p></li>
<li><p>Press <code>Ctrl + Alt + i</code> on a PC or
<code>Command + Option + i</code> on a Mac.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To run code chunks, you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Run a <em>full single</em> chunk by clicking on the green
triangle at the top-right of the chunk.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <em>part of a chunk</em> with
<code>Ctrl/Command + Enter</code> just as you would in a normal
script.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <em>all chunks up to this point in the document</em> by
clicking on triangle with the line below it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, R’s output appears right under the chunk in the raw
Quarto <code>.qmd</code> file.</p>
<p>To run <em>all chunks</em> in a document you simply
<strong>Render</strong> the document. As you’ve already seen, this
exports the text, code chunks, and output into a pretty and portable
format like HTML or PDF.</p>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Try adding a new code chunk to the default
Quarto document that adds your favorite five numbers and returns the
sum. Add a new heading and some narrative text to explain what the chunk
is doing, as well. Re-knit the document to see the results.</p>
<p>The last thing we need to talk about with chunks are the
<strong>chunk options</strong>. An R chunk might look like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Code_Chunk2.png" alt="*Another code chunk.*" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
<em>Another code chunk.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that first line. That tells us three things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Quarto should evaluate this block as <code>r</code> code (rather
than, say, Python code, which it can also handle).</p></li>
<li><p>The name of this chunk (<code>cars</code>). This always appears
after the language name and a single space. This helps with navigating
between chunks in the document (otherwise it’ll just be listed as
something like “Unnamed Chunk 1” so it can be hard to find your way back
to it quickly). Use descriptive names where possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Chunk options, which always appear after the language, the
optional name, and a comma <code>,</code>. These serve as instructions
for the knitting process around specific chunks of code. The most common
options include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p><code>{r [CHUNK-NAME], include=FALSE}</code>. This causes Quarto
not to print the code <em>or</em> any output.</p></li>
<li><p><code>{r [CHUNK-NAME], echo=FALSE}</code>. This causes Quarto not
to print the code, but it will print any output.</p></li>
<li><p><code>{r [CHUNK-NAME], eval=FALSE}</code>. This causes Quarto to
print the code, but <em>not</em> any output.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>You can list multiple options for a chunk, all separated by commas.
The Quarto cheat sheet has a list of more chunk options.</p>
<p>Note that when you open a new Quarto document it shows you how to add
options by using a line such as <code>#| echo: false</code> in the code
chunk itself, but I prefer the method I’ve outlined above. Either is
fine, though!</p>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Suppress the code chunk you wrote above from
being printed or showing its output when you re-knit the document.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-text-formatting-in-quarto" class="section level3">
<h3>Text Formatting in Quarto</h3>
<p>There are many ways to format text in Quarto. You can also use LaTeX
to expand this, but that’s beyond the scope of this course so don’t
worry about it. Here are some of the more common formats you might want
to have in a knitted document:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>*Text surrounded by single asterisks*</code> will be
<em>italicized</em></p></li>
<li><p><code>**Text surrounded by double asterisks**</code> will be
<strong>bold</strong></p></li>
<li><p><code>[This is how you add a hyperlink to Google](www.google.com)</code></p></li>
<li><p>You create headers using between one <code>#</code> and six
<code>######</code> pound signs (fun fact: they’re technically called
octothorps!). Fewer pound signs are bigger headings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Make some text of your choice italic, add a
hyperlink, change one of the heading sizes, and re-knit the
document.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-my-quarto-formatting-expectations-a-manifesto"
class="section level3">
<h3>My Quarto Formatting Expectations: A Manifesto</h3>
<p>Part of learning how to use R as a data analyst is learning how to
cleanly and professionally communicate your findings, not just how to
code. To that end a substantial portion of your grade is going to depend
not just on getting the correct solution, but in presenting it in an
easy-to-digest way.</p>
<p>On Canvas, if you click on “Modules”, you’ll see a section titled
“Quarto Organization Example.” My advice is to download the HW1 Example
file and edit it for your first assignment. Then when another assignment
comes around open the previous finished assignment, save it to a
different name, delete <em>most</em> things except for one example of
each main component (e.g. a heading, a code chunk), and then create the
next assignment in it. This should start you from a good template each
time. But the key things I’m looking for are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Headings</strong>. Use them to orient and walk readers
through your document. Note how I use them in my Tutorials and try to
mimic that.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They should be brief (usually one line) but clear so the reader
knows what to expect in a given section (e.g. Loading Data and Packages,
Analysis of Flight Departure Delays).</p></li>
<li><p>Start big with a title, then go smaller and smaller for
sub-sections as needed. If you get to the 4th level (<code>####</code>)
or smaller I recommend bolding so it stands out from the normal
text.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>All code should be in <strong>code chunks</strong> (i.e. when
writing it should be in a box with a gray background). It should not be
simply written into the document outside of a chunk except in very
specific cases such as pulling a single number into a paragraph of
written text that will auto-update (none of which I’ll be asking you to
do in this course).</p></li>
<li><p>Code chunks should be interweaved with explanatory text before
and/or after.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I favor the following pattern:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If needed (i.e. not self-explanatory or made clear elsewhere like
in a heading), 1-2 sentences of text before a chunk (depending on its
length) explaining what the code is doing.</p></li>
<li><p>The code chunk itself.</p></li>
<li><p>If needed (i.e. it produces output like a plot or table that
isn’t self-explanatory), a brief analysis of the output after the
chunk.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat as you move through the document.</p>
<p>Use your judgement as to whether 1/3 are needed in any particular
case, but keep in mind you shouldn’t assume your audience can quickly
figure out what your code is doing by looking at the code itself and, if
the output was produced to answer a specific question, highlight that
answer in an analysis of the output.</p></li>
<li><p>Package names (e.g. <code>nycflights13</code>), data frame names
(e.g. <code>flights</code>), variable names (e.g. <code>tailnum</code>),
and function names (e.g. <code>mean()</code>), <em>if written in text
outside of a code chunk</em>, should be formatted with backticks ``</p>
<ul>
<li>Please note backticks `` are different from apostrophes ’’.
Backticks are on the tilde key next to the 1-key on a standard English
QWERTY keyboard.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do not <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italicize</em> entire
paragraphs or blocks of text. Most text should simply be typed in
without formatting. Use bolding, italics, and other formatting for key
words and phrases you want to emphasize.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re confused about what I mean by any of this, refer to the HW1
Example file. I’ve designed it to reflect the level of detail and effort
I want to see on your assignments.</p>
