<h2>Intro and Setup</h2>
<p>We just spent several weeks doing (what I hope was) some of the most
fun stuff in R - data viz. We sort of started with our dessert. Now,
unfortunately, we have to take a week for some vegetables. But then
we’ll get back into entrees for a couple weeks - then, sadly, some more
vegetables, and then close out with some side dishes. OK, I’m really
torturing this metaphor but I’m writing this just before lunch. You get
the point. Moving on.</p>
<p>We need to load 4 packages today. You’ll likely need to install a
couple of them first, but relax - remember, <code>p_load()</code> should
take care of that for you. <strong>Just remember to run this code in
your own script before proceeding.</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>pacman::p_load(tidyverse, readxl, data.table, rstudioapi)</code></pre>

<h2>Working Directories</h2>

<em>Like these wise fellows!</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>…do you have a moment to talk about <strong>working
directories</strong>? Well whether you do or not that’s what we’re about
to do.</p>
<div id="section-finding-your-working-directory" class="section level3">
<h3>Finding Your <strong>Working Directory</strong></h3>
<p>Whenever you open RStudio it sets a <strong>working
directory</strong>, which is the place where it’s going to look for (or
in the case of exporting, try to write) any files by default, <em>unless
you specify otherwise</em>. You can see where it is using the
<code>getwd()</code> command. Try it in your own script.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Find out what your working directory is
getwd()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-setting-or-changing-your-working-directory"
class="section level3">
<h3>Setting or Changing Your Working Directory</h3>
<p>I <em>typically</em> want my <strong>working directory</strong> to be
either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The folder where the script I’m working in is located,
OR</p></li>
<li><p>If it’s part of an R Project (we haven’t learned about those yet,
but <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html">here’s an
intro from R4DS</a>), the parent directory for the project
itself</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But what if you use <code>getwd()</code> and notice R/RStudio has
chosen a different working directory for some reason?</p>
<p>There are two ways to set the <strong>working directory</strong> to
be the location of the file you’re working in. I usually like to include
this code in the top of my files:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Set the working directory to be the location of the script 
#or R Markdown document you&#39;re working in
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, more recent versions of RStudio allow you to do this
manually by going to the top menu and clicking
<code>Session &gt; Set Working Directory... &gt; To Source File Location</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(&quot;./images/setting_wd_manually.jpg&quot;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">
<em>How to set your working directory to the script location
manually.</em>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-how-a-working-directoryuh-works"
class="section level3">
<h3>How a Working Directory…Uh, Works</h3>
<p>As noted above, the <strong>working directory</strong> is the default
place where R and RStudio will look for or try to write files to. For
example, go to Canvas and download the file
<code>obesity-diabetes.csv</code> from the Datasets Module. This is a
simple data frame that contains the prevalence of diabetes and obesity
in all 50 states for 2017. <em>Do not move it from the Downloads
folder.</em></p>
<p>Now try and import the file using this code in your own script (we’ll
discuss what this does more in a moment):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>diabobes &lt;- read_csv(&quot;./obesity-diabetes.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I bet you got an error, didn’t you? Something about how
<code>obesity-diabetes.csv</code> doesn’t exist in your current working
directory? That’s because R looked for the CSV file by default in your
<strong>working directory</strong> - it had no idea to look in downloads
instead. To fix this you can either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Specify the actual location of the file:
<code>diabobes &lt;- read_csv("[FILE PATH TO DOWNLOADS FOLDER]/obesity-diabetes.csv")</code></p></li>
<li><p>NOT RECOMMENDED: Change your working directory to match the
location of the file</p></li>
<li><p>(USUALLY) THE BEST SOLUTION: Save the CSV file to your working
directory <em>or</em> a sub-directory thereof.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Save the CSV to the folder of your working directory, then re-run the
import code above. Did it seem to successfully import the data this
time?</p>
<div id="section-whats-with-the-dot" class="section level4">
<h4>What’s With the Dot?</h4>
<p>Note in the above code that little <code>./</code> that begins the
file path. The <code>.</code> is a stand-in for the working directory.
So that code really tells R “go to the working directory”, then “look
for the file named <code>obesity-diabetes.csv</code> there.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-accessing-sub-folders-in-your-working-directory"
class="section level4">
<h4>Accessing Sub-Folders in Your Working Directory</h4>
<p>Often your working directory will have sub-folders (also known as
sub-directories) you’ll want to access - for example, a folder just for
data.</p>
<p>In your working directory, create a new folder called
<code>datasets</code>. Save <code>diabetes-obesity.csv</code> there.
Then try this code to import it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>diabobes &lt;- read_csv(&quot;./datasets/obesity-diabetes.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This should work. It tells R to go to your working directory -
indicated by the <code>.</code> - then the folder <code>datasets</code>,
then search <em>there</em> for <code>obesity-diabetes.csv</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-accessing-parent-folders" class="section level4">
<h4>Accessing Parent Folders</h4>
<p>Occasionally you’ll want to move “up” (to a “parent” directory)
rather than “down” (to a “child” sub-directory) of your working
directory. You can move up one level by starting the file path with
<code>..</code> - try moving the dataset to the folder one step
<em>above</em> your working directory, then use this code to import
it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>diabobes &lt;- read_csv(&quot;../obesity-diabetes.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You can also combine these tricks to move up, then down. If you need
to take one step “up” in your file structure, then access another
sub-directory, just start with <code>..</code> and then specify the
sub-directory you need. Note you can specify as many sub-directory steps
as you want, just like with a normal file path.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-working-directories-in-rmarkdown"
class="section level3">
<h3>Working Directories in RMarkdown</h3>
<p>RMarkdown notebooks (<code>.Rmd</code> files) work differently than R
scripts.</p>
<p>In RMarkdown files, the working directory is <em>automatically</em>
set to be the location of the RMarkdown file. As long as that’s what you
want, there’s no need to set it explicitly.</p>
<p>If that’s <em>not</em> what you want you have to change the working
directory, but differently than how we discussed before. The most common
way would be in the <code>setup</code> chunk, usually at the beginning
of the RMarkdown document just below the YAML header. You would use code
like this inside that chunk:
<code>knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '[FILE PATH FOR WORKING DIRECTORY]')</code>.</p>
<p>For more on manipulating working directories in RMarkdown, see <a
href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/working-directory.html">chapter
16.6 of Yihui Xie’s incredible resource the <em>R Markdown
Cookbook</em></a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-data-import" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Import</h2>
<p>There are several ways you can get data into R to work on it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Data that’s native to R (for example, <code>cars</code>) - we’ve
already covered this</p></li>
<li><p>Data that’s included in a package (for example, <code>mpg</code>
in <code>tidyverse</code> or <code>penguins</code> in
<code>palmerpenguins</code>) - we’ve already covered this, too</p></li>
<li><p>Importing so-called “<strong>flat</strong>” data files, most
commonly comma-separated variable (<code>.csv</code>) or Excel
(<code>.xls</code> or <code>.xlsx</code>) files - we’ll cover this
today, and it’s what most of you will do most of the time</p></li>
<li><p>Querying SQL or other “<strong>relational</strong>” databases
straight from R - this is beyond the scope of this course</p></li>
<li><p>Querying data from an <strong>application programming interface
(API)</strong>, commonly in hierarchical <code>JSON</code> or
<code>.xml</code> formats - this is <em>way</em> beyond the scope of
this course</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have no idea what 4 and 5 mean, that’s fine! We’re not
covering them. I’m just including them to be <em>explicit</em> about
what we’re not covering.</p>
<div id="section-importing-a-csv" class="section level3">
<h3>Importing a CSV</h3>
<p>The simplest way to do this is to use <code>readr::read_csv()</code>
- <code>readr</code> is one of the packages loaded with the
<code>tidyverse</code>. Save the diabetes and obesity CSV somewhere
sensible, then try importing the CSV and assigning it to a
<strong>tibble</strong> named <code>diabobes</code>. Be sure to change
the working directory in your code if needed:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>diabobes &lt;- read_csv(&quot;./obesity-diabetes.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(&quot;./images/successful_import.png&quot;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/successful_import.png" alt="*A successful import.*" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
<em>A successful import.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>You should see the data frame appear in your
<strong>Environment</strong> tab on the upper right, as well as a
message like the above. This indicates R read the file, provides a list
of the <strong>columns/variables</strong> it imported, and the data type
it “<strong>parsed</strong>” (guessed and identified) each variable as.
You’ve already learned a bit about these data types, and we’ll discuss
it more in a later tutorial, so no need to go into more detail now.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-importing-an-excel-file" class="section level3">
<h3>Importing an Excel File</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll see data in Excel workbooks, especially with
multiple tabs. Try downloading the dataset
<code>obesity-diabetes-excel.xlsx</code> from Canvas, and save it in an
appropriate location. Open it in Excel and take a look at the data in
both tabs.</p>
<p>Now say you wanted to import the data in the <em>second</em> tab.
Here’s where <code>readxl::read_excel()</code> comes in handy. To grab
the data on any sheet simply use the <code>sheet = [SHEET NAME]</code>
argument, like below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>diabobes_trend &lt;- read_excel(&quot;./obesity-diabetes-excel.xlsx&quot;, sheet = &quot;diabobes_trends&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You can also specify the second sheet with <code>sheet = 2</code>,
but this is more fragile. What if you later move this data to be the
<em>third</em> sheet in the workbook? So my recommendation is just use
sheet names.</p>
<p>Make sure the file isn’t open in Excel when you try to import it or
you’ll get an error. To fix that, simply close the file in Excel.
Curiously this isn’t a problem when importing CSVs. Go figure.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-need-for-speed-turn-to-fread" class="section level3">
<h3>Need for Speed? Turn to <code>fread</code>!</h3>
<p>If you have a REALLY big file, like a bunch of genomic data,
sometimes <code>read_csv()</code> just isn’t fast enough. In these
situations I recommend the flexible and incredibly fast
<code>data.table::fread()</code>. It works like this (make sure you load
<code>data.table</code>!):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>diabobes &lt;- fread(&quot;./obesity-diabetes.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In 95% of cases you won’t be able to detect any practical difference.
But if your importing is taking a long time, try
<code>fread()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-removing-files-you-no-longer-need"
class="section level3">
<h3>Removing Files You No Longer Need</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll want to remove (delete) files, like old or temporary
data frames, you no longer need. It helps to have a less cluttered work
environment and also can free up memory for other tasks. You do this
with the <code>rm()</code> function. Just put the name of the object, or
objects separated by commas, you want to get rid of.</p>
<p>In your own script, try assigning a number to an object called
<code>x</code>, then remove (delete) that object.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-data-export" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Export</h2>
<div id="section-exporting-data-to-a-csv" class="section level3">
<h3>Exporting Data to a CSV</h3>
<p>Instead of <strong>reading</strong> data in, let’s
<strong>write</strong> it out to a file. To export the diabetes and
obesity data to a CSV file called
<code>diabetes-obesity-exported.csv</code>, use code like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>write_csv(diabobes, &quot;./obesity-diabetes-exported.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You first specify the name of the object you want to export, then the
location you want to save it and the name you want to give the exported
file. Remember the <code>.</code> once again refers to your working
directory.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-exporting-data-to-excel" class="section level3">
<h3>Exporting Data to Excel</h3>
<p>There are ways to export data directly to an Excel workbook, but I’d
<em>usually</em> recommend against this. So I won’t cover it in detail
here. But if you want more information, <a
href="http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/writing-data-from-r-to-excel-files-xls-xlsx">here’s
a basic intro</a>. It works more or less like reading from Excel files,
but you need a different package.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-exporting-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Exporting Plots</h3>
<p>The other main thing you’ll often want to export are plots. We
already covered the basics of that in Tutorial 1.3 and so won’t rehash
it here.</p>
<p>Just note that rather than specifying the full file path as we did in
1.3 before you knew what <strong>working directories</strong> were, you
can leverage your working directory to shorten that considerably.
There’s nothing special about specifying the paths for plots or images
vs. data files.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-exporting-taking-so-long-its-a-fright-turn-to-fwrite"
class="section level3">
<h3>Exporting Taking So Long It’s a Fright? Turn to
<code>fwrite</code>!</h3>
<p>If you have a REALLY big file, like a bunch of genomic data,
sometimes <code>write_csv()</code> just isn’t fast enough. In these
situations I recommend the flexible and incredibly fast
<code>data.table::fwrite()</code>. It works like this (make sure you
load <code>data.table</code>!):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fwrite(diabobes, &quot;./obesity-diabetes-exported.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In 95% of cases you won’t be able to detect any practical difference.
But if your exporting is taking a long time, try <code>fwrite()</code>.
This has saved me a <em>ton</em> of time in the past.</p>
</div>

<div id="section-summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
This tutorial was a bit boring, but we needed to cover setting working
directories and importing and exporting (some common types of) data.
Next up is learning how to manipulate data frames like a deity.
