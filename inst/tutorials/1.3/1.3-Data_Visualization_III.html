<h2>Intro and Setup</h2>
<p>First as usual we need to load a few packages and datasets (you’ll
also need to install five more packages - <code>gapminder</code>,
<code>ggridges</code>, <code>ggthemes</code>, <code>RColorBrewer</code>,
and <code>hexbin</code> - but <code>pacman::p_load()</code> should take
care of that for you. <strong>Make sure to run this in your own script
as you follow along!</strong></p>

<p>Explore <code>gapminder</code> a bit using the techniques you’ve
already practiced. It’s a dataset of some basic information about a
bunch of countries over time.</p>

<div id="section-visualizing-two-or-three-variables"
class="section level2">
<h2>Visualizing Two (or Three) Variables</h2>
<p>Oftentimes when you get data you want to look at the relationship
between two (or more) variables. Let’s take a look at some ways you can
do this and the different techniques for continuous vs. categorical
variables.</p>
<div id="section-two-continuous-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Two Continuous Variables</h3>
<p>Let’s ask a seemingly-easy question: Do bigger penguins tend to have
longer bills? A classic way to look at this - the relationship between
two continuous variables - is a scatterplot.</p>
<div id="section-scatterplots" class="section level4">
<h4>Scatterplots</h4>
<p>Write the code for a basic scatterplot below (you should be able to
copy-paste from an earlier tutorial, as all great programmers do):</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="scatter" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>#A simple scatterplot of body mass vs. bill length</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>What do you notice about the relationship between bill length and
body mass? Does bill length increase or decrease with increasing body
mass? What does that relationship look like? Do there seem to be any
outliers?</p>
<p>It looks <em>sort of</em> linear but with a lot of variation. There
seems to be a particular group near the upper left that’s off from the
rest of the main line. What could that be? Think for a moment before
looking below.</p>
<div id="section-adding-a-third-variable" class="section level5">
<h5><strong>Adding a Third Variable</strong></h5>
<p>What if that weird outlier group is a different species?</p>
<p>We could add a third variable, such as <code>species</code>, to this
chart using colors, shapes, facets, or other approaches. Modify your
scatterplot above to color and shape your points by species:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="scatter2" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>#A simple scatterplot, but with the points colored and shaped by species</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>That adds a lot of information! Does the relationship look tighter
within each species than when we look at all penguins together? Which
relationship are you actually most interested in? Whether, across an
arbitrary mix of three species of penguins, bigger bodies mean larger
bills? Or whether, within Adelie, Chinstrap, and/or Gentoo penguins,
bigger bodies mean larger bills?</p>
<p>I’d argue the latter is more meaningful. Let’s continue with that.
What does the relationship look like within each species?</p>
</div>
<div id="section-smoothing-lines" class="section level5">
<h5><strong>Smoothing Lines</strong></h5>
<p>Maybe we could try fitting a straight line to the data for each
species to describe the relationship, since that looks plausible
(although there’s quite a bit of variation).</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="scatter_line"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>#A scatterplot with a line for each species
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm,
                                      color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) # Specifies we want a straight line</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Note now that we have two <strong>geoms</strong> (chart type layers),
so we made what aesthetics we could be <strong>global</strong> rather
than <strong>local</strong> to avoid typing them twice.</p>
<p>In the code above, <code>geom_smooth()</code> adds a trend line to
our scatterplot data from <code>geom_point()</code>. You could also just
print the line without the scatterplot, but unless there’s too much data
to plot I always prefer to see the underlying data itself.</p>
<p>This geom comes with one key additional argument:
<code>method =</code>. It has four main options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>method = "lm"</code>: “lm” stands for linear model.
Essentially, create the smooth line with linear regression. <em>By
default</em> this will be a straight line, as above, unless you also
explicitly define another <code>formula =</code> argument.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The default <code>formula =</code> argument is
<code>formula = y ~ x</code>, meaning a straight line of the form y =
b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>x, where b<sub>0</sub> is a y-intercept and
b<sub>1</sub> is the slope associated with x.</p></li>
<li><p>You could also specify <code>formula = y ~ x + I(x^2)</code>
which would fit a quadratic curve of the form y = b<sub>0</sub> +
b<sub>1</sub>x + b<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup></p>
<ul>
<li>What’s that funny <code>I()</code>? This tells R to interpret
something “as-is” rather than trying to do something else with it. Here
we want R to take <code>x^2</code> as “x squared” rather than what R
would <em>typically</em> do with <code>^</code> in a formula, which is
complicated and not something we need to get into right now.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You can also specify higher-degree polynomials or other functions
like <code>formula = y ~ log(x)</code>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>method = "loess"</code>. This stands for “LOcally Estimated
Scatterplot Smoothing” and produces more flexible curves that are more
“responsive” to the data. So where our use of <code>method = "lm"</code>
above forced the trend line to be a straight line,
<code>method = "loess"</code> can look like anything. <strong>This is
the default method for data with &lt; 1,000
observations.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><code>method = "gam"</code>. This stands for “Generalized
Additive Model” and, like LOESS, produces more flexible curves that are
more “responsive” to the data than “lm.” LOESS and GAMs are
mathemtically different and often yield somewhat different results, so
sometimes it’s useful to compare the two. <strong>This is the default
method for data with &gt; 1,000 observations.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Irritatingly, you also need to specify
<code>formula = s(x, bs = "cs")</code> to explicitly specify you want a
GAM smoother rather than a straight line, which it will give you by
default if you try and run it on data with &lt; 1,000 observations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>method = "glm"</code>. This stands for “generalized linear
model.” Don’t worry about it right now; it requires a greater
understanding of statistics than many of you may have right
now!</p></li>
</ul>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Above we forced the relationship between bill
length and body mass within each species to be described by a straight
line. But maybe it isn’t really linear; try fitting LOESS and GAM models
instead. Compare your results. Is the linear model “close enough” for
you in this case? Which one would you choose to present in an
analysis?</p>

<div id="section-line-graphs" class="section level4">
<h4>Line Graphs</h4>
<p>Line graphs are great, among other situations, when one of your
continuous variables is time-based. Here’s an example of a simple one
using the <code>gapminder</code> data.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="line_graph"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Pick just a few countries so we don&#39;t try to plot all 142.
# Don&#39;t worry about the details of this code right now
gap_line &lt;- filter(gapminder, country %in% c(&quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;China&quot;))

#A line graph
ggplot(data = gap_line, mapping = aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, shape = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() # Adds points to the line</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>One thing that’s important to note for line graphs is you typically
need to use a <strong>grouping aesthetic</strong> if you have more than
one observation at a given time (or other x-value). For example, the
<code>gapminder</code> data has one measure of <code>gdpPercap</code> in
1987 for every country. Line graphs can’t deal with that, so you have to
tell them to plot one line <em>per country</em> by specifying a grouping
aesthetic like <code>color = country</code>,
<code>shape = country</code>, or simply
<code>group = country</code>.</p>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Try modifying the code above to plot a line
graph with: a.) a different shape <em>and</em> color for each country;
b.) the <em>same</em> shape and color for each country, but still one
line per country (that is, grouped by country).</p>
<p>Then see what happens when you remove all of them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-one-continuous-and-one-categorical-variable"
class="section level3">
<h3>One Continuous and One Categorical Variable</h3>
<p>Here you have a lot of visualization methods to choose from, but they
all boil down to taking a univariate continuous visualization and either
a.) using a <strong>grouping aesthetic</strong> (like
<code>color</code>, <code>fill</code>, or <code>shape</code>) to
sub-divide them by the levels of a categorical variable on the same plot
or b.) using <strong>facets</strong> to print one sub-plot for each
level of the categorical variable.</p>
<div id="section-frequency-polygons" class="section level4">
<h4>Frequency Polygons</h4>
<p>Let’s look at the distribution of body mass by penguin species.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="fp1" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Frequency polygon by species
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_freqpoly() </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Here the groups (species) are close to equal in size. But what if you
have major differences? Let’s go back to our <code>diamonds</code> data
and look at the distribution of price vs. cut.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="fp2" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Write the code for a frequency polygon plot of price, colored by cut</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>The distributions are a little hard to differentiate because the
relative heights. Just based on the number of diamonds the “ideal” cuts
dwarf all the others, making the others’ curves look flat. Instead we
could standardize them all to the same height by modifying our code
slightly to add a non-default <code>y</code> aesthetic:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="fp3" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Frequency polygon by cut, standardized
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price, y = after_stat(density), color = cut)) +
  geom_freqpoly() </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>What the heck is <code>after_stat(density)</code>??? It’s a
<strong>computed variable</strong> that <code>geom_freqpoly()</code>
automatically creates behind the scenes. It standardizes all the counts
in each group so that the area under every curve will be 1.0.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-histograms" class="section level4">
<h4>Histograms</h4>
<p>Let’s look again at the distribution of body mass by penguin species.
Unfortunately, as you hopefully recall, <code>geom_histogram()</code>
has some weird behaviors when you try and plot all the groups on the
same graph, and they’re a bit tricky to fix. Instead, why don’t we try
facetting?</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="histogram"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Histogram polygon by species - can you fill in the facet_wrap() function as instructed below?
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap() # Force 3 rows, one for each species, so plots display vertically rather than side-by-side</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>That works! We can facet whenever we use a grouping aesthetic - it’s
just a question of whether you want all your data displayed on one plot
or a series of sub-plots.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-density-plots" class="section level4">
<h4>Density Plots</h4>
<p>These work pretty much like frequency polygons except they
automatically standardize every curve to have the same area.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="density" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Frequency polygon by species
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) # If the densities overlap, make them partly transparent. Try tweaking alpha until you get a look you like</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-ridgeplots-joyplots" class="section level4">
<h4>Ridgeplots (Joyplots)</h4>
<p><strong>Ridgeplots</strong> display densities staggered vertically in
the same pane. You just need to specify the categorical variable as a
<code>y</code> aesthetic.</p>
<p>NOTE: These plots require you to install and load the
<code>ggridges</code> package! They aren’t built in to
<code>ggplot2</code> itself. Here’s a simple example using
densities:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="joy_density"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Density ridgeplot by species

</div>
<p>You can also do ridgelines that look more like frequency polygons
rather than densities, but it’s a little more complicated. We’ll skip it
for now. <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html">Here
are more details in case you’re curious.</a></p>
<p>One more thing: these are technically called ridgeplots in R, but
you’ll see them referred to sometimes as <strong>joyplots</strong>. Why?
The band <em>Joy Division</em> has an album cover that looks like
this:</p>

<h3>Two Categorical Variables</h3>

write that out in a data table or visualize those counts.</p>
<div id="section-bar-charts" class="section level4">
<h4>Bar Charts</h4>
<p>Bar charts are probably the easiest visualization for two categorical
variables. We’ve already seen an example in our <code>diamonds</code>

<h2>Customizing Your Plots</h2>
<p>There are endless ways you can customize your plots in
<code>ggplot2</code>. We’ll go through a few of the more common ones you
might encounter below. The <a
href="http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/">Cookbook for R’s “Graphs”
section</a> or the more detailed <a href="https://r-graphics.org/">R
Graphics Cookbook</a> by Winston Chang are handy references for more
details.</p>
<p>We’ll start with this graph:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="badgraph" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>#A simple scatterplot

</div>
<p>This graph isn’t as good as it could be. It lacks a title. The x- and
y-axis labels look weird and are uninformative. Maybe you don’t like the
colors, or where the axes start and end. We’ll work on improving this
with our customizations below.</p>
<div id="section-titles-subtitles-and-labels" class="section level3">
<h3>Titles, Subtitles, and Labels</h3>
<p>You can (and usually should) add a brief descriptive title and/or a
subtitle to a chart. There are several ways to do this, but the one I
like is the <code>labs()</code> function, short for
<strong>labels</strong>, because it can be used for much more than
titles and subtitles.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="section-legend-position-title-and-labels"
class="section level3">
<h3>Legend Position, Title, and Labels</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may want to move the legend from its default position
on the right to below the graph or somewhere else. This is especially
true if you have long labels that compress the graph horizontally.
Moving it to below the graph, of course, will slightly compress it
vertically, though. It’s your choice which is better.</p>
<p>I also tend to think having a title on the legend is extraneous - the
labels and chart title should make it clear what the values of legend
are (e.g. different species of penguin).</p>
<p>Finally, we can manually change the values of our legend labels if we
want. Make sure you have the right order by printing the plot with the
automatic legend first, though.</p>
<p>We can make the first two these changes using the very flexible
<code>theme()</code> function, but for the third we have to annoyingly
manually change the labels for each aesthetic to which we’ve mapped
species (color and shape):</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="legends1" data-completion="1"

</div>
<p>The <code>legend.title =</code> argument probably looks confusing.
What is <code>element_blank()</code>??? Don’t worry about it for now.
Just know that in the <code>theme()</code> function, that’s how you
remove a text element (like a title) entirely.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-axis-limits" class="section level3">
<h3>Axis Limits</h3>
<p><code>ggplot()</code> tries to automatically choose sensible minimum
and maximum values for the x- and y-axis, but sometimes you’ll want to
change that.</p>
<p>One of the most common reasons I use this is to force the y-axis to
start at <code>0</code>. <strong>A compressed y-axis is a <em>very</em>
common way people misleadingly present data. <code>ggplot()</code> will
unfortunately sometimes do this - not maliciously, just by
default.</strong> For example, consider the following (fictional)
example of the 5-year survival for prostate cancer when treated with a
new drug (Expensitol) or an older one (which we’ll call the
Control):</p>
<p><img src="1.3-Data_Visualization_III_files/figure-html/misleading-1.png" alt="" width="624" /></p>
<p>Wow, that looks like a <em>huge</em> difference, doesn’t it!? But
look closely at the y-axis. How big is the difference in survival,
really?</p>
<p>What if we used a less misleading y-axis, such as one forced to run
from 0 to 100%?</p>
<p><img src="1.3-Data_Visualization_III_files/figure-html/not_misleading-1.png" alt="" width="624" /></p>
<p>Ah, now the groups look more equal and “Expensitol” looks less
effective, doesn’t it? <strong>Always, always, ALWAYS check the y-axis
of any graph you make or that anyone tries to show you. NEVER assume it
starts at zero, or that what looks like a big difference actually
is!</strong></p>
<p>Now look back above. Does our penguin graph start at zero? Well, no.
Does it feel misleading to start around 30 mm? Honestly, in this case
probably not. It’s fine because we’re not trying to show a massive
variation in bill length, just the association between bill length and
body mass. But let’s set the y-axis to start at <code>0</code>
anyway.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="axislim1" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>#A simple scatterplot
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm,
                                      color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = &quot;Penguin Body Mass and Bill Length by Species&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;Palmer Station, Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research&quot;,

       y = &quot;Bill Length (millimeters)&quot;,
       caption = &quot;Look at me! I&#39;m a caption!&quot;) +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;, 
        legend.title = element_blank()) +

</div>
<p>We accomplish this with the <code>ylim()</code> function. The first
number you pass is the minimum you want, and the second is the maximum;
we used <code>NA</code> to allow R to keep its default maximum. You can
modify the x-axis the same way with <code>xlim()</code>.</p>
<p>The benefit of this is that now the variation in bill length - if
that was something that you were interested in - now doesn’t look as
misleadingly wide as if you made the bottom start at 30. But there’s
also now a lot of wasted space on the graph, everything is compressed
vertically, and the association between bill length and body mass is
harder to see. So there are benefits and drawbacks to having the y-axis
start at zero in this particular case, and I’m OK with either way.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if you have a chart that relies on <em>area</em>
- like a bar chart - your y-axis needs to start at zero. I would extend
this rule to most graphs that are trying to make a <em>comparison</em>
between two or more categorical groups. Line graphs and scatterplots -
which are more often used to show relationships between two variables or
trends over time - don’t <em>have</em> to include zero, and in some
cases shouldn’t because zooming out too far can obscure important
relationships. But there are always exceptions, so use your critical
thinking to decide if a graph you produce - or consume - is using
misleading axes. <a

<div id="section-reordering-factors" class="section level3">
<h3>Reordering Factors</h3>
<p>By default factors, like <code>species</code>, are often ordered
alphabetically (or in another way you previously specified). Let’s
create boxplots of bill length by species:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="box_reorder"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Boxplot by species
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot() </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>You know what annoys me about this chart? The species aren’t in order
from shortest to longest median bill length. Let’s fix that.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="box_reorder2"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code># Boxplot by species
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(species, bill_length_mm, FUN = median, na.rm = TRUE),
                                      y = bill_length_mm)) </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>You can see that the thing we changed was the <code>x =</code>
aesthetic. Let’s walk through that line of code. We asked R to reorder
the factor <code>species</code>, based on their bill length, using the
<em>median</em> bill length (rather than the mean or minimum or some
other measure) to do the ordering.</p>
<p>We also had to make sure to ask R to <em>remove</em> any NA values of
bill length first, using <code>na.rm = TRUE</code>. What happens if we
forget that bit? Try removing it!</p>
<p>1 Adelie and 1 Gentoo penguin have <code>NA</code> values for bill
length. Their median bill length becomes <code>NA</code>, and they are
automatically both considered <em>bigger</em>, and thus plotted to the
right of, Chinstraps. That doesn’t give us what we want! So we have to
explicitly tell R “hey, just take the median of those penguins whose
bill lengths we know, OK?”</p>
<p>We can also reorder the levels of a factor in our data to any order
we want <em>prior</em> to plotting. We’ll talk more about that in a
later tutorial, though.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-themes" class="section level3">
<h3>Themes</h3>
<p><strong>Themes</strong> are different pre-made ways to visually
present your graph. They alter things like background color, grid lines,
and font sizes and types. They are very useful quick ways to make major
changes to your graph without having to type the same long, specific,
clunky code over and over again. Once you get more advanced you may even
want to create your own themes!</p>
<p><code>ggplot2</code> has some common ones built in, like
<code>theme_bw()</code>:</p>

<div id="section-color-palettes" class="section level3">
<h3>Color Palettes</h3>
<p>You may not like the default colors <code>ggplot2</code> chooses
(usually called the “rainbow palette”). They are bad for showing
continuous data (gradients), may not be great for categorical data with
a natural ordering (for example, Low-Medium-High or
Mild-Moderate-Severe), may cause issues for those who are colorblind,
and may not show up well in black and white. We’ll look at two
alternatives.</p>
<p>First, the <code>viridis</code> scales built into
<code>ggplot2</code>. These are best for when you want to color a
continuous variable or ordered factor. In fact, you’ve already seen it
in diamonds because it’s the default for ordered factors in
<code>ggplot2</code>!</p>
<p>Second, the scales built into the <code>RColorBrewer</code> package.
Various options are nice for continuous, ordered, or non-ordered
categorical variables.</p>
<p>For a more thorough discussion of the proper use of colors in data
viz, I recommended <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/colors/">this

<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="colors_viridis3"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, 
                                      color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = &quot;viridis&quot;)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>The <code>RColorBrewer</code> package, however, contains other
excellent scales for ordered and unordered categorical variables. These
were developed by experts to both be graphically attractive and to work
for colorblid folks. Let’s take a look at our options:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>display.brewer.all()</code></pre>
<p><img src="1.3-Data_Visualization_III_files/figure-html/cbpals-1.png" alt="" width="624" /></p>
<p>Notice how these <strong>palettes</strong> are split into three
blocks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first block is best for <strong>sequential</strong> data such
as ordered factors that are constantly increasing or decreasing. These
colors increase from lighter to darker. An example would be diamond cut
grades.</p></li>
<li><p>The second block is best for <strong>qualitative</strong> data
such as unordered categories like penguin species. These palettes don’t
have any particular order.</p></li>
<li><p>The third block is best for <strong>diverging</strong> data.
Think of a survey where you can answer Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral,
Disagree, or Strongly Disagree. Or political leanings. There’s an anchor
in the center and the data get more extreme in either
direction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll mostly leave you to play around with these on your own, but
here’s an example of how you can specify a qualitative palette for
penguin species. Try a few different ones until you find one you
like!</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="colors_brewer1"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, 
                                      color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) </code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p><code>RColorBrewer</code> will automatically choose the first N
categories of a <strong>sequential</strong> or
<strong>qualitative</strong> scale. It will automatically work from the
inside-out for <strong>diverging</strong> scales.</p>
<p><code>RColorBrewer</code> palettes - at least sequential and
diverging ones - <em>can</em> also be used for continuous variables, but
they are more specially designed for categorical ones. You can use them
for continuous variables by using function
<code>scale_color_distiller()</code> instead. As the help page warns,
though, “your mileage may vary” (meaning you may get good or bad
results) depending on your specific case. Do not use qualitative scales
for continuous data.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-colors-vs.-fills" class="section level4">
<h4>Colors vs. Fills</h4>
<p>Remember the difference between a <code>color</code> and a
<code>fill</code>. Both <code>viridis</code> and
<code>RColorBrewer</code>, annoyingly, have different functions for
each. Usually you simply replace “color” with “fill” in the function
name.</p>
<p>If you wanted to choose an <code>RColorBrewer</code> palette for a
<em>fill</em> aesthetic, for example, you would need to use
<code>scale_fill_brewer()</code>.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind this is something you’ll probably mess up more than
once. It’s a common error when plotting in R!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-custom-colors" class="section level4">
<h4>Custom Colors</h4>
<p>You can also define custom color or fill scales for your graphs. I
usually advise against this because professionals have created the
<code>viridis</code> and <code>RColorBrewer</code> scales for a reason.
But check out the R Graphics Cookbook for more information if you find
yourself compelled to create your own scale!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-manual-customization-cheatsheet-and-map"
class="section level3">
<h3>Manual Customization Cheatsheet and Map</h3>
<p>This all probably feels a little abstract and like a lot of very
specific commands you have to memorize. First of all, you don’t have to
memorize them - I look them up via, for example, Googling regularly.</p>
<p>But here is <a
href="https://henrywang.nl/ggplot2-theme-elements-demonstration/">an
excellent map and cheatsheet</a> that names and describes how to
manually alter any specific part of a ggplot (each of which has its own
obscure name in R-speak) using the <code>theme()</code> function. This
covers how to change titles, legends, axes, and backgrounds. We
discussed how to make some of the more common of these alterations
above, but others we haven’t:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/theme_map.png" alt="*A map and cheat sheet for altering different parts of a ggplot.*" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
<em>A map and cheat sheet for altering different parts of a ggplot.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>The themes we discussed above basically change a bunch of these
individual settings at once with a single command such as
<code>theme_bw()</code>, but if you want more fine-grained control to
alter specific elements of your plot individually, that’s where this
cheatsheet and the flexible <code>theme()</code> function come in
handy.</p>

<div id="section-dealing-with-overplotting" class="section level2">
<h2>Dealing With Overplotting</h2>
<p><strong>Overplotting</strong> occurs when the same elements are
plotted right over each other or are simply too close to differentiate.
This most commonly happens with scatterplots with large numbers of data
points or when plotting discrete data. There are several options for
dealing with this, some of which you’ve already encountered.</p>
<div id="section-jittering" class="section level3">
<h3>Jittering</h3>
<p>The first is “jittering” using <code>geom_jitter()</code>. Observe
what happens when we plot engine size vs. highway mileage in the
<code>mpg</code> dataset:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="jitter1" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Because there are only a few possible values of <code>displ</code>
(engine size) we have some points plotted over one another.
<code>geom_jitter()</code> fixes that by automatically adding a little
bit of random noise in both directions:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="jitter2" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0"
data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>#Try using geom_jitter() rather than geom_point()</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Notice now we can see each data point more clearly. It doesn’t badly
affect our interpretation of the data, either; it just helps with
visualizing it.</p>
<p>You can alter the amount of the jitter in the horizontal and vertical
directions with <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> arguments -
refer back to our attempt to create a raincloud plot in Tutorial 1.1.
But <em>usually</em> the defaults work fine unless you’re trying to do
something fancy like we were.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-alpha" class="section level3">
<h3>Alpha</h3>
<p>You’ve already learned about alpha, too. It controls point
transparency. Setting it to a lower value can help with visualizing
overplotted data. Consider this example from <code>diamonds</code>:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="diamond_alpha"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>#A simple scatterplot of just the first 5000 rows to simplify plotting (54K rows total)
ggplot(data = head(diamonds, 5000)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), alpha = 0.4)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p><mark>Challenge:</mark> Try dropping the alpha to different values to
see how it helps with overplotting. Do you think it helps? Can you tell
where most of the diamonds are really located now?</p>
</div>
<div id="section-hexbin-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Hexbin Plots</h3>
<p>The last strategy I’ll offer you is <strong>hexbin</strong> plots.
They’re simple to do in <code>ggplot2</code>, but you need to make sure
you load the <code>hexbin</code> package. They basically bin scatterplot
values into slightly-larger hexagons, then plot them with a color to
indicate how many points are in that bin. Here’s an example:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="diamond_hex"
data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0" data-pipe="|&gt;">
<pre class="text"><code>#A simple scatterplot of just the first 5000 rows to simplify plotting (54K rows total)
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_hex(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Do you see how that helps you see where the majority of diamonds are
located better than our basic scatterplot?</p>

<h2>Storing and Exporting <code>ggplot</code> Objects</h2>
<div id="section-saving-and-storing-ggplots" class="section level3">
<h3>Saving and Storing <code>ggplot</code>s</h3>
<p>Plots are stored just like any other object, such as a
<code>data.frame</code>. You can assign it to an object using code like
this, then come back to manipulate it later. Try running it in a script
of your own. Remember to load the penguins data first!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Saving a plot
penguin_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()</code></pre>
<p>You can print this object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Print your saved plot object
penguin_plot</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
## (`geom_point()`).</code></pre>
<p><img src="1.3-Data_Visualization_III_files/figure-html/print-1.png" alt="" width="624" /></p>
<p>You can add to the saved plot object using <code>+</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Add a title, change the x-axis label, and re-print
penguin_plot2 &lt;- penguin_plot +
  labs(title = &quot;Penguin Body Mass vs. Bill Length&quot;, 
       x = &quot;Body Mass (grams)&quot;)

#Print your saved plot object
penguin_plot2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
## (`geom_point()`).</code></pre>
<p><img src="1.3-Data_Visualization_III_files/figure-html/add-1.png" alt="" width="624" /></p>
<p>You can also add new geoms or anything else this way.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-exporting-a-plot" class="section level3">
<h3>Exporting a Plot</h3>
<p>If you’re producing Quarto document you never have to worry about
exporting a plot because it will simply display in-line with your code
and explanatory text. But what if you need to export it for, say, a
Powerpoint presentation?</p>
<p>The easiest way is probably <code>ggsave()</code>.</p>
<p>We could save our penguin plot as a .png file, for example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggsave(filename = &quot;C:/Users/elzat/Dropbox/QTM_150/Tutorials/0 - Basics/penguin_plot2.png&quot;,
       plot = penguin_plot2)</code></pre>
<p>When you run this you’ll see it’s saved as a default size. You can
alter that by specifying new values in a <code>width</code> and/or
<code>height</code> argument.</p>
<p>If the text or points look too big or don’t quite fit in the exported
picture you can also try changing the <code>scale</code> argument from
its default value of 1. Counterintuitively, <em>increasing</em>
<code>scale</code> (e.g. specifying <code>scale = 1.5</code>) makes
everything look smaller; <em>decreasing</em> it makes everything look
bigger. Give it a try while exporting your own plot!</p>
