## Intro and Setup

First as usual we need to load a few packages and, now, datasets. **Make sure to run this in your own script as you follow along!**

```{r setup}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, palmerpenguins)

data(mpg)

data(diamonds)

data(penguins)
```

In addition to `penguins` we're going to use a couple new datasets from the `tidyverse` package for this tutorial: `mpg` (which stands for "miles per gallon" - this is about cars) and `diamonds`. Explore these datasets a bit first using the techniques you've already learned.

```{r explore, exercise = TRUE}
#Explore mpg - write your own code below


#Explore diamonds - write your own code below

```

## Aesthetics (Continued)

We'll start off with a more detailed dive into **aesthetics**. You've already learned a few - do you remember what they are? Briefly review that portion of Tutorial 1.1 if not.

Aesthetics are often most powerful when used to *add* information to a graph, rather than just changing colors and shapes. We've already seen an example of that with grouping, splitting, and coloring our histogram of flipper length by species. To explore this further, though, let's start taking a look at graphs that display two variables. 

I don't know about you all, but I'm kind of curious about the relationship between body mass and flipper size in penguins. Do bigger penguins have longer flippers? Let's start with a simple scatterplot:

```{r scatter_basic, exercise = TRUE}
#A simple scatterplot
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm))

```

What's the problem with this graph? Think back to our histogram.

Remember that Gentoo penguins are bigger than Adelies. Maybe we're curious whether they also have longer flippers. How can we look at that?

### Grouping Aesthetics

#### Overview and Color
Just like with our histogram, let's `color` our scatterplot by species. Can you figure out how to modify the code below to do that? **Don't look below this code box until you do.**

```{r scatter_grouped, exercise = TRUE}
#Scatterplot colored by species - need to modify code
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm))

```

Review the plot for a minute. How do the species compare on body mass and flipper length?

In this code `color` is an example of a **grouping aesthetic** - it tells `ggplot()` to group the data by species and do something different (in this case, use a different color) for each one. These always appear inside `mapping = aes()`. To be more explicit we could use this code which accomplishes the same thing but specifies the `group` aesthetic:

```{r scatter_grouped_explicit}
#Scatterplot colored by species
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species,
                           group = species))

```

R just figured out you wanted it to group by species once you asked for it to color by species, so you didn't have to tell it specifically. We'll see some examples below where the `group` aesthetic itself is actually useful, though.

Remember we use `color =` above rather than fill because we're coloring points, and we put it within `mapping = aes()` because we're mapping it to a variable in the data.

#### Point Shapes and Sizes

One problem with just using colors to differentiate groups of interest is colorblindness. 1 in 8 males and 1 in 200 females suffer from colorblindness, a common form of which involves the inability to distinguish between red and green hues. So would they be able to tell the difference between Adelie and Chinstrap penguins above?

How can you make your graphs more accessible to these people? How about using **shapes** instead of or in addition to colors? Simply add the `shape =` aesthetic to the code below:

```{r scatter_shape}
#Scatterplot colored and shaped by species - need to modify code
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species))

```

Now even if you're colorblind you can differentiate the species!

You can also change the **size** of points instead. Simply use the `size =` aesthetic.

```{r scatter_size, exercise = TRUE}
#Scatterplot colored and sized by species
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species,
                           size = species))

```

Notice the warning this threw us, though. R doesn't like the fact that you mapped **size** to a **discrete** (i.e. categorical) rather than a continuous variable. **Shape** is a categorical aesthetic (you're a circle, a square, a triangle, etc.), so it makes sense to map to a categorical variable like `species`. **Size**, though, is a continuous number - R would rather you map that to a continuous variable. Like, say, `bill_length_mm`. Can you figure out how to do all that below?

```{r scatter_size2, exercise = TRUE}
#Scatterplot colored and shaped by species, and sized by bill length


```

Now our graph not only shows the body mass and flipper length of penguins by species. Not only is it good for colorblind folks. Now it *also* shows that Adelie penguins tend to have shorter bills, too!

In my opinion this graph is far too complex and crowded with information. I don't usually like to use **size** as a *group* aesthetic because I find it tends to clutter the graph and confuse readers. But **size** is useful for other things, and now you know how to use it!

#### Transparency (Alpha)

You can also change the transparency of points (or bigger shapes) using an aesthetic called **alpha**. Why "alpha?" It's complicated, but if you're really curious [check this out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing).

```{r scatter_alpha, exercise = TRUE}
#Scatterplot colored and alpha-ed by species
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species,
                           alpha = species))

```

Using **alpha** as a group aesthetic has the same problem as **size**, but we've already seen an example where it's useful outside the grouping context. Do you remember? 

Remember when we split our histogram by species? We needed to make the histogram bars partly transparent so you could see when the species overlapped in size.

### Manually Changing Colors and Shapes

Color and shape aesthetics are great for grouping, but they can also be changed manually.

Let's reproduce our basic scatterplot, but with all green squares instead of the default black circles. Would these go inside or outside the `mapping = aes()` argument?

```{r scatter_manual1, exercise = TRUE}
#Scatterplot of green squares
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm), 
             color = "darkgreen", shape = 15)

```

How does R know `shape = 15` means a square? R has 25 built-in shapes for points:

```{r img1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "*R shape codes.*"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/R_shape_codes.png")
```

* Shapes 0-14 are hollow outlines. Their outline color is controlled with the `color` aesthetic. You cannot give them an interior fill color.

* Shapes 15-18 are shapes whose color is controlled with the `color` aesthetic. 16 is the default value if you don't specify a different shape - a black circle whose color you change with `color`. You can think of these shapes as having *no* outlines, just a color.

* Shapes 19-24 are shapes whose outline is controlled with the `color` aesthetic and whose interior color is controlled with `fill`.

<mark>Challenge:</mark>Try some different shapes and colors in the scatterplot above until you find a combination you like!



### Manually Changing Sizes and Transparency

Size and transparency (alpha) aesthetics are most useful when being changed manually. Say you want to make the points on a scatterplot all bigger or smaller. Try changing the `size =` aesthetic below and seeing how the plot changes.

```{r scatter_manual2, exercise = TRUE}
#Scatterplot colored and alpha-ed by species - play around with the size aesthetic!
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm), size = 1.5)

```

The `alpha =` aesthetic is most useful when you have overlapping data. This can be points on a scatterplot or, as we saw before, histograms. Note alpha is like a percentage, so it has to be between 0 (0%, fully transparent) and 1 (100%, fully opaque). Play around with with transparency parameters for both kinds of figures below:

```{r scatter_manual3, exercise = TRUE}

#Scatterplot colored and alpha-ed by species - play around with alpha values!
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm), alpha = 0.25)

#Histogram of flipper length, with different fills for each species, improved
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species),
                 position = "identity",
                 alpha = 0.5) #Play around with alpha values!
```

Notice how in the scatterplot some points look darker than others when you reduce **alpha**? That shows points with the same values that were previously obscured because they were stacked on top of one another. Increasing the transparency (decreasing alpha) is one way to reveal overlapping data. 

```{r overlap, echo=FALSE}
  
quiz(
  question("Do you remember what *other* strategy we used to reveal overlapped data points in Tutorial 1.1?",
      answer("geom_jitter()", correct = TRUE, message = "That's right! geom_jitter() adds a little bit of random noise to spread out overlapped points without greatly messing up the actual relationships in the data."),
      answer("color ="),
      answer("geom_density()"),
      answer("fill = "),
      type = "learnr_radio",
      allow_retry = TRUE)
)  
```


### Line Type and Thickness

There are two more common aesthetics we should talk about, but they relate to lines, which we haven't used yet. Let's take our scatterplot from above and fit a straight line through the data points - like running a linear regression. Notice we used some global aesthetics here to avoid having to type them separately in each **geom** layer.

```{r scatter_line, exercise = TRUE}
#A simple scatterplot with a line
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

We can change the color (`color =`), thickness (`lwd =`), and type (`linetype =`) of that line. For example:

```{r scatter_line_custom, exercise = TRUE}
#A simple scatterplot with a thicker dashed red line
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              linetype = "dashed", color = "red", lwd = 3)

```

Hopefully `color =` and `lwd =` (line width, or thickness) are pretty self-explanatory by now. `linetype =` is slightly more complicated because how do you know what values it can take on? Try typing `?linetype` to see possible values. You can define it either using the value in quotes, such as `"dashed"`, or the corresponding integer (for a dashed line, just type `linetype = 2`).

<mark>Challenge:</mark> Try changing the color, thickness, and type of the line above to something you like. Try numbers and words for the `linetype` aesthetic.

Notice the line also has a confidence interval (CI) around it - it's a 95% confidence interval by default. You can remove it (not recommended), change its width (to, say an 89% confidence interval), or change its color or transparency:

```{r scatter_line_ci, exercise = TRUE}
#A simple scatterplot with a thicker dashed red line and modified CI
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              linetype = "dashed", color = "red", lwd = 3,
              se = TRUE, # Set to FALSE to remove the CI
              alpha = 0.6, fill = "blue", level = 0.95) # Change CI transparency, color, width (default 95%)
              
```

<mark>Challenge:</mark> Play around with all the aesthetics above to get a better feel for what they do!

## Facetting

This is element #7 in our **Grammar of Graphics** framework. We've already covered #1 (data), #2 (geoms), and #3 (aesthetics). Now we're skipping ahead slightly to cover something simpler before #s 4-6.

**Facets** are an easy way to break a single plot into sub-plots by groups, usually defined by a categorical variable. Consider the below plot of `displ` (a measure of a car's engine size) vs. `hwy` (miles per gallon on the highway, a measure of fuel efficiency) from the `mpg` dataset. We've split the graph by car type (`class`):

```{r scatter_facet, exercise = TRUE}
#Scatterplot of engine size vs. highway mileage, by car class
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() # Instead of specifying we want only a straight line we allow ggplot to use its default approach, called LOESS, that fits more flexible relationships. Note R lets you know this is what it's doing when you run this code.
              
```

That's kind of a mess, isn't it? What if we split this into multiple plots? That seems like it should be a pain to do, though, right?

Well, no! Not in the `tidyverse` anyway. It takes one line of code in `ggplot()`.

```{r scatter_facet2, exercise = TRUE}
#Scatterplot of engine size vs. highway mileage, by car class
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2) # The syntax looks a little funny but it just means facet by class, and arrange the resulting facets in 2 rows
              
```

The benefit here is now that each plot is separate there's less clutter and overlap. The drawback is that it's harder to compare across facets. Do compacts have generally higher highway mileage than SUVs? On a single graph it's easy to tell, here your eyes have to dart back and forth a bit to make a guess. Nonetheless, you'll find facetting *extremely* useful, I promise.

You can also facet by two variables using `facet_grid()` instead:

```{r scatter_facet3, exercise = TRUE}
#Scatterplot of engine size vs. highway mileage, by car class
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) #drv = front, rear or 4-wheel drive; cyl = number of cylinders in engine
              
```

The `facet_grid()` row is your first experience with **formula notation** in R. You'll see it come up a few more times later, but in this context it just tells R to create rows of plots from `drv` and columns from `cyl`.

Notice that a few combinations of these variables are common, some are uncommon, and some don't exist at all.

#### Facetting "Scales"

Notice that in both the above examples the X and Y axes had the same start and end point. This led some graphs to look like points are "smooshed" over into one side or even one corner. What if we wanted to change that?

```{r facet_scale, exercise = TRUE}
#Scatterplot of engine size vs. highway mileage, by car class
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2,
             scales = "free") # The default is "fixed", meaning the scales are fixed (the same) across sub-plots
              
```

Now everything is plotted on a different scale. The benefit is its easier to see the relationships within each group and the data are less "smooshed." The problem is that it's harder to compare across sub-plots. 

Look again - do compacts and SUVs have about the same average highway mileage, or is one higher than the other? You now have to compare the y axes and notice that the bottom for "compact" is nearly the same as the top for "suv"!

<mark>Challenge:</mark> You can allow *just* the x or y axes to vary while keeping the other fixed by using `scales = free_x` or `scales = free_y`. Try this in the code above to see the effects!

## Statistical Transformations (Stats)

This is element #4 in our **Grammar of Graphics** framework. We've already covered #1 (data), #2 (geoms), #3 (aesthetics), and #7 (facetting).

When I got engaged to my wife I had a jeweler re-set a diamond from my grandmother's engagement ring. Part of that process involved getting that diamond appraised. How could I know I was getting a good deal? What should a diamond of a certain size and quality be worth? We can explore the `diamonds` dataset to get an idea!

Consider a basic scatterplot of two variables from the `diamonds` dataset. Note `carat` is a measure of the weight of a diamond; in case you're curious, it's equivalent to 200 mg.

```{r shuffle, echo = FALSE}
rows <- sample(nrow(diamonds))
diamonds <- diamonds[rows, ]
```


```{r scatter_diamond, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "shuffle"}
#A simple scatterplot of carat vs. price, using just the first 5000 rows to simplify plotting (54K rows total)
ggplot(data = head(diamonds, 5000)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))

```

Here the values of `carat` and `price` map *directly* onto their x and y coordinates with no changes. You might say they are *identical*. In fact, behind the scenes that's exactly what `ggplot()` is telling R. 

Just as each **geom** takes a set of **aesthetics**, it also takes a **stat** (statistical transformation) that tells it to do something to the data before mapping to specific aesthetics. The default **stat** for `geom_point()` is `stat = "identity"`, which in English means "do nothing" - map the data just as they are (identically).

<mark>Challenge:</mark> Note that we didn't need to specify the argument `stat = "identity"` in the code above because it's the default stat for `geom_point()` and it's what we wanted. Try adding it to the above code, though, as a new **argument** to `geom_point()` - you should get the exact same results, you've just made it more explicit. 

How can you know what the default stat is for a geom? Try typing `?geom_point` into the Console to go to its help page, and look under the **Usage** heading. You'll see each argument with their default values, one of which is `stat = "identity"`.

Let's look at a more interesting example, though: a bar chart. My grandmother's diamond had an "Ideal" cut. How does that compare to the diamonds in this dataset? How many of each type of cut are there?

```{r bar_diamond, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "shuffle"}
#A simple bar chart
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))

```

OK, looks like R plotted "Good" as about 5,000. Can you find that value anywhere in the dataset? How did R decide to map "Good" to 5,000? Perhaps it applied some kind of **statistical transformation**?

Can you figure out what the default **stat** is for `geom_bar()`?

```{r bar_stat, echo=FALSE}
  
quiz(
  question("The default **stat** for `geom_bar()` is:",
      answer("identity"),
      answer("bin"),
      answer("prop"),
      answer("count", correct = TRUE),
      type = "learnr_radio",
      allow_retry = TRUE)
)  
```

### The "count" Stat

`stat = "count"` works with categorical variables. It's an algorithm (**transformation**) that tells `ggplot()` to first *count* the number of observations at each level of the x aesthetic (in our case, `cut`) and plot *that*, rather than any actual value from the dataset. Here's an illustration taken from *R for Data Science* chapter 3.7:

```{r img2, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "*How a bar chart and stat = 'count' work.*"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stat_count.png")
```

### Changing a Default Stat

With some geoms like `geom_point()` you'll rarely change the default **stat**. Bar charts are a weird case, though. For instance, what if you had data like this instead?

```{r bar_sum, echo = FALSE}
cut_counts <- diamonds %>% 
  group_by(cut) %>% 
  summarize(n_diamonds = n())
```

```{r ccprint, echo = FALSE}
cut_counts <- diamonds %>% 
  group_by(cut) %>% 
  summarize(n_diamonds = n())

cut_counts
```

And then you tried to make a bar chart like this:

```{r bar_diamond_summary, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "bar_sum"}
#A simple bar chart of summary data
ggplot(data = cut_counts) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))

```

What the heck? Why is it plotting every group as 1? Think about it for a moment before reading on.

It's because `ggplot()` is trying to use `stat = "count"` to count the number of observations for each value of `cut`, and it only finds one for each! But you want it to plot the actual *value* of `n_diamonds`. The *identical* value, one might say. 

Here's how you would fix the code. Unfortunately you have to both change the **stat** and do one other thing.

```{r bar_diamond_summary2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "bar_sum"}
#A simple bar chart of summary data
ggplot(data = cut_counts) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = n_diamonds), stat = "identity") # If you use stat = "identity", you also have to tell ggplot() what value to use for the height of the bar (y) 

```

### Other Stats

Many other geoms use non-"identity" stats when plotting. For example:

* Histograms and frequency polygons use `stat = "bin"` to "bin" your data in different groups and then plot bin counts.

* Density plots use `stat = "density"` to compute the density values it then plots (don't worry about further details for now).

* Smoothers like `geom_smooth()` use `stat = "smooth"` to first fit a smoothed curve to your data. It then plots the values (predictions) of the curves rather than your data itself.

* Boxplots use `stat = "boxplot"` to compute a 5-number summary (min, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, max) that it then plots.

Check the [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf) for a more complete list of available **stats**.



## Position Adjustments (Positions)

This is element #5 in our **Grammar of Graphics** framework. We've already covered #1 (data), #2 (geoms), #3 (aesthetics), #4 (stats), and #7 (facetting).

Bar charts are once again the easiest way to demonstrate what we mean by a **position adjustment (position)**.

My grandmother's diamond had an "Ideal" cut and a color grade of "H". Color grades technically run from D-Z, where just like your grades earlier letters are better. I wonder how her diamond - which, as a reminder, I'm using for my wife's engagement ring - compares to this huge dataset of diamonds in cut and color. Am I giving her a particularly nice diamond? (NOTE: I honestly think diamonds are far too expensive and often morally questionable due to how they are mined. My wife did not even want a diamond, and in no way am I suggesting this is something you should do for your own partners. But since I already had my grandmother's sitting around and she had expressed a desire for me to use it, I did.)

Let's create a bar chart to investigate this:

```{r bar_diamond2, exercise = TRUE}
#A simple bar chart of summary data
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color))

```

Where does my grandmother's - now my wife's diamond - fit in? Is it a common cut? A common color? Near the best, the worst, or kind of in the middle on both these dimensions?

Notice how the default is for `geom_bar()`, when using the fill aesthetic mapped to a second variable, to produce a *stacked* bar chart. Why does it do that? Check the default of the `position =` argument in `geom_bar()`. Do you remember how to do that? 

```{r pos_quiz, echo=FALSE}
  
quiz(
  question("The default **position** for `geom_bar()` is:",
      answer("identity"),
      answer("fill"),
      answer("stack", correct = TRUE),
      answer("dodge"),
      type = "learnr_radio",
      allow_retry = TRUE)
)  
```

### Changing the Default **Position**

So the default for a bar chart is `position = "stack"`, which unsurprisingly produces a stacked bar chart. What do the other options do? Try each of them below.

```{r bar_diamond3, exercise = TRUE}
#A simple bar chart of summary data
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color), position = "stack") #Try "identity", "fill", and "dodge"

```

* `"identity"` isn't very good for bar charts because now the bars overlap (notice the y-axis is much shorter than before, and the "G" color group - the largest one for most cuts - is top rather than "D").

    <mark>Challenge:</mark>If you want to see more clearly that these are overlapping try making the bars somewhat transparent. Do you remember how to do that?
    
* `"fill"` makes all the bars the same height - 1.0 - so you see the *proportion* of diamonds of each cut that are in each color grade. This can be useful or not depending on the question you want to answer about your data!

    Does there seem to be a lot of variation in the distribution of colors in diamonds of different cuts?
    
* `"dodge"` creates side-by-side bars for each color within each cut. Again, this may be useful or not depending on how you want to visualize your data and what exactly you're trying to compare.

    This is probably the most common position adjustment I make in R. It makes it easier to compare the number of diamonds of each color within and across groups groups. In a stacked chart it's a little harder to eyeball whether one chunk of a bar is bigger than another.

## Coordinate Systems

This is element #6 in our **Grammar of Graphics** framework. This is the last element we have to introduce! While it's arguably the most complicated one we'll barely scratch the surface, so it'll seem simple.

Most of the time - and all the time in this class - you'll plot on a Cartesian (X-Y) coordinate system. `ggplot()` is capable of laying down all sorts of other systems, though, such as polar coordinates (remember high school math?) and maps for spatial data. Just know that's something `ggplot()` *can* do.

The main coordinate system technique I want to introduce to you now is `coord_flip()`, which flips the X and Y axes. Say you wanted a horizontal bar chart rather than a vertical one. In `ggplot()` it's easy - just add one line of code!

```{r bar_horiz, exercise = TRUE}
#A simple horizontal bar chart of summary data
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = class)) +
  coord_flip()

```

While it isn't a problem here, this is often useful if you have a lot of classes and long labels that overlap on the bottom. Flipping the coordinates means the labels have a lot more room to stack vertically rather than having to fit on a single line.

Or maybe you just like the look of horizontal bars better! I'm not here to judge.

##Summary

In this tutorial we covered how to add more information to charts using color, shape, and size aesthetics. We also learned a bit about a few ways to customize your charts to your liking.

Finally, we introduced all the rest of the elements of the **grammar of graphics**. 

```{r gg, eval = FALSE}

ggplot(data = <DATA>) + # 1. A dataset
  
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>( #2. A "geometric object", or geom - basically a chart type!
    
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>), # 3. Aesthetic mappings - specifying X and Y variables, changing colors, sizes, and fonts, and so on
     
     stat = <STAT>, # 4. A statistical transformation, or "stat" - often unnecessary because the default is fine
     
     position = <POSITION> # 5. Positional adjustments - for example, do you want bar charts stacked or side-by-side?
       
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> + # 6. Coordinate system - most often Cartesian (2-dimensional X-Y axes, but can also do polar, or maps for spatial data!)
